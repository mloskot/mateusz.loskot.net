![STLport Logo](/images/logos/stlport-logo.gif)Today, I published my first article on the [Pocket PC Developer Network](http://www.pocketpcdn.com).
My article is a kind of crash course explaining how to use [STLport](http://stlport.sourceforge.net) with [eMbedded Visual C++](http://msdn.microsoft.com/mobility/othertech/eVisualc/default.aspx) compiler and IDE to develop [Windows CE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/embedded/windowsce/default.aspx) applications. I hope it will encourage new Windows CE software developers to try STLport. I found this STL implemenation as a great piece of software, useful in my daily work and more complete STL implementation than that shipped with eVC++ SDKs.



If you are curious what I wrote follow this link to [How to use STLport with eMbedded Visual C++](http://www.pocketpcdn.com/articles/articles.php?&atb.set(c_id)=51&atb.set(a_id)=6463&atb.set(c_id)=51&atb.set(c_id)=51&atb.set(c_id)=51&&atb.set(c_id)=51&atb.set(a_id)=6463&atb.set(c_id)=51&atb.set(c_id)=51&atb.set(c_id)=51&atb.perform(details)=&).
