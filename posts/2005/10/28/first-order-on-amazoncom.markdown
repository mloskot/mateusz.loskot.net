Three days ago I ordered two books on [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com). In 24 hours after I placed my order I got a message from Amazon with confirmation that my credit card has been authorized. Hurray! Amazon also confirmed _order has shipped_. Nice, isn't it. I said to my self: In two weeks you will smell your brand new books at home. But what's that? Amazon inform me in their message that **estimated delivery date: December 16, 2005**. Hm, how could it be - let me ask. Don't you have any aricrafts there, in USA?







Let's see it in details. So, two clicks on the [Google Map Pedometer](http://www.webwalking.com/googlemap.htm) and I have [distance](http://www.webwalking.com/googlemap.htm?zl=15&x=-46.40625&y=37.16031654673677&path=g}nwFnk~hRypedAygz|U) between the _middle_ of the USA and the middle of Poland. The result is **8196.531** km or if you prefer miles, then it's **5093.088** mil. OK, so how many days this trip will take? December 16 minus October 26 gives **51 days**! Maybe they will ship my books on the raft, who knows :-) So, the only think I can do is to accept it. I only hope they don't wet my books in the ocean. Huh? OK, here are a few more calculations made by [Google](http://www.google.com), just for fun: [8196.531/51](http://www.google.pl/search?q=8196.531%2F51) = **160.716294** km per day and this gives [160.716294/24](http://www.google.pl/search?q=160.716294%2F24) = **6.69651225** km/hour. Not so fast :-(







Finally, I think I should say a word about the books, So here you are:

[Mapping Hacks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007035/103-5449325-1967039) by Schuyler Erle, Rich Gibson and Jo Walsh

To make shippment costs lower I decided to order second book. First, it was one of MapServer book but Tyler suggested me to buy this one - Mapping Hacks - for _learn and fun_.



By the way, Amazone.com sells Tyler's book about 10$ cheaper than [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/webmapping/) :-)
When I get and read those books I will write some review.
