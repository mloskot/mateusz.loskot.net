People living in the [New Orleans, Louisiana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana) are like in a trap.  The city lies below sea level and it's still sinking (...agriculture)! Thousands of people live more than 2 metres below sea level surrounded by the waters of the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrai. It may seem water was waiting for an opportunity to destroy New Orleans. It happend. [Hurricane Katrina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina) attacked on August 29, 2005. Everyone around the World knows what Katrina did to people and cities of Louisiana...

Today, after a month, we can take a look deeper inside the hearth of disaster even remotely. [GeoCommunity](http://www.geocomm.com) announced [Hurricane Katrina Disaster Viewer](http://spatialnews.geocomm.com/dailynews/2005/sep/20/news1.html) launched by ESRI:

_The Hurricane Katrina Disaster Viewer went live Saturday, September 3, 2005, and will remain available indefinitely in the wake of Hurricane Katrina_

and

_The data presented in the viewer is provided directly by public and commercial organizations such as FEMA and the U.S. Postal Service_

I put in the [gallery](http://mateusz.loskot.net/gallery/)  two maps taken from the [Hurricane Katrina Disaster Viewer](http://arcweb.esri.com/sc/hurricane_viewer/) which I think present enormity of this disaster very well:

Red colour on the maps symbolize area of catastrophic damage of New Orleans under water! Terrifying!
More maps and photos are in [Hurricane Katrina gallery](http://mateusz.loskot.net/gallery/hurricane-katrina)

There is a good analysis of Hurricane Katrina in more technical manner published in [Hurricane Season 2005: Katrina](http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/h2005_katrina.html) report by [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov).

The most important question today is _Will it happen again?_. I really would not want to be forced to ask myself such questions. I wish Louisiana good luck and no hurricane and any other kind of disasters again!
