Thanks to my, hopefully, open minded attitude, I sometimes let myself to dive into _unknown_ with honest hope to find _unexpected_.





Today at lunchtime I let myself loose across [Twitter](http://twitter.com) archives and I came across an interesting account, or I rather should say: I fell into evil ways. It is [@OpenAtMicrosoft](https://twitter.com/#!/OpenAtMicrosoft). Hmm, another marketing specialist at [Microsoft](https://twitter.com/microsoft) [buzz'ing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_buzzwords#Science_and_technology) about the [NKTOB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kids_on_the_Block) (tm), means _new keyword on the block_. Or, it is just Microsoft twitting daily menu from their newly opened cafeteria. But now, they presumably say what they mean:





> source for info on Microsoft and interoperability, open source and open standards





[Interoperability @ Microsoft](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/archive/2009/01/14/welcome.aspx)






By the way, it is a foothold of [Interoperability @ Microsoft](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/). (For those who may have problems with interpreting the _@_ sign, like my grandfather for example, it means the same as English word "at" as in _Kids at the House_.)





In spite of that my eyes nearly dried out of the openness, I went for it and skimmed and voil?: [Microsoft Announces SQL Server ODBC Driver for Linux!](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brian_swan/archive/2011/10/13/microsoft-announces-sql-server-odbc-driver-for-linux.aspx). It _will soon be widely available to customers_. Yay!

It's an evil good news of the day and I'm keen in trying it out as soon as I polish the ODBC backend in [SOCI](http://soci.sourceforge.net/). I hope to stop worrying about which one to use, [unixODBC or iODBC](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7548825/what-are-the-functional-differences-between-iodbc-and-unixodbc), for SQL Server at least. Life may become easier for [OGR SQL Server](http://gdal.org/ogr/drv_mssqlspatial.html) driver users too.





I also hope, Microsoft will consider to offer _the fastest development environment for C/C++ programmers_ for Linux. Namely, Visual Studio.





Yes, I am radically open minded. _I can take on the most incredible of challenges, even [surfing an inflatable crocodile](http://www.moneysupermarket.com/c/videos/you%27re-so-moneysupermarket/0011805/)_.
