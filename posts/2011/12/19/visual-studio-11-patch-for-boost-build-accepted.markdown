A few days ago I submitted patch with [small fixes for Boost.Build](/?p=2841) to support Visual Studio 11 toolset. The [patch has been accepted](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6283) and committed to the current trunk in Boost repo. Thanks to [Volodya](http://vladimir_prus.blogspot.com/) for reviewing the patch.
