[This month](http://www.osgeo.org/node/1244), OSGeo Foundation is conducting annual election of new [OSGeo Charter Members](http://www.osgeo.org/charter_members).





I have [nominated Martin Daly](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2011-November/009641.html) (CTO of [Cadcorp](http://www.cadcorp.com)) for Charter Member of the OSGeo Foundation.



Martin has long-standing experience in development of geospatial software and development, and [adoption of open standards](http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2009/03/cadcorp.html) for geospatial under his belt.





Martin has used and supported numerous open source software projects. Martin led Cadcorp to offer first implementation of PostGIS by a GIS vendor, to become a [GDAL/OGR Silver Sponsor](http://www.cadcorp.com/press_releases/2007_pr2.htm), to contribute funds and time of Cadcorp development team to make the wheels of [PostGIS Raster project (aka WKT Raster) spinning](http://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/wiki/WKTRaster/PlanningAndFunding). [Improvements in PostgreSQL](http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2005/10/concurrency-for-postgis.html) are also on not-a-short list of contributions to the Free and Open Source Software projects, as is [GEOS](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/).





[Martin was one of the original members](http://www.cadcorp.com/about_us_ogc/cadcorp_and_the_ogc.htm) of the [OGC Architecture Board (OAB)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/oab). He was also the main author of the [OpenGIS Coordinate Transformation Services Specification](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/ct) as well as participated in developing several other OpenGIS specifications. Martin is one of authors of the [GeoJSON Format Specification](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html) and actively participates in future development of GeoJSON.





Martin is a member of the [Advisory Board](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham_Centre_for_Geospatial_Science) of the Open Source Geospatial Lab (OSGL) at the University of Nottingham [Centre for Geospatial Science](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/cgs/research/researchareas/opensourcegeospatialresearch.aspx).





Martin also participates and leads Cadcorp involvement in the annual [FOSS4G WMS Benchmark](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Benchmarking_2010).





I believe Martin Daly's experience and contributions make him a valuable candidate for the OSGeo Charter Member.
