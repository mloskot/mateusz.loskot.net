I have just [announced](http://lists.boost.org/boost-announce/2011/01/0281.php) results of the [formal review](/?p=2131) of **IO** and **Toolbox** extensions for [Boost Generic Image Library](http://boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/gil/doc/index.html) (GIL). Shortly, formally, the review concluded with 1 NO and 7 YES votes what means both extensions have been accepted into [Boost C++ Libraries](http://boost.org/libs/).





The task has been finished, but the mission is still ongoing. [Lubomir Bourdev](http://www.adobe.com/technology/people/sanjose/bourdev.html) (Adobe) - Boost.GIL lead developer summarised it quite well:





> The problem with I/O is that you can never declare success.
All we can hope for is push the boundary as much as we can, and leave the rest for the next update. 





Christian Henning has done great job developing the extensions and reviewers confirmed it. It was pleasure for me to manage the [review process](http://www.boost.org/community/review_schedule.html).
