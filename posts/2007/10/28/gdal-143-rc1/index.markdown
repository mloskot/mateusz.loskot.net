It's been quite a long way, but finally GDAL 1.4.3 RC1 was issued today. Initially, the 1.4.3 was planned to be final patch release for 1.4.x but _recently heard rumors_ tell me that we can expect 1.4.4 in near future.





Here is the RC1 announcement I posted on the [gdal-dev](http://lists.maptools.org/mailman/listinfo/gdal-dev/) list:
