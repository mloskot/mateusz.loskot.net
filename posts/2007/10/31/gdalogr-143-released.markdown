[![The GDAL/OGR Team](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1362/1444603686_05a792016f_s.jpg) ](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/1444603686/)Finally, the long awaited stable release of GDAL and OGR has been published. Current stable release number is **1.4.3**. There is not much of magic of [numerology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerology) behind this number and it just says it consists of 3rd iteration of patches to 1.4 stable release.






The official GDAL/OGR 1.4.3 [announcement](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-announce/2007-October/000009.html) says:

Folks,

The GDAL Team is pleased to announce the release of GDAL/OGR 1.4.3.
This is intended to be a successive bug fix release after GDAL/OGR 1.4.2
and it's extending the GDAL 1.4.x stable branch.
This release does not include the many new features in the development
trunk (which will appear as GDAL/OGR 1.5.0).

With GDAL/OGR 1.4.3, 65 Trac tickets were addressed:
