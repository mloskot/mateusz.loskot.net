[![GDAL logo](/images/logos/gdal-logo.png)](http://www.gdal.org/)Yesterday, I [announced](/2007/04/09/gdal-141-is-out/) the new release of GDAL 1.4.1. Today, it turned out that the package for 1.4.1 was generated from the **development branch** - trunk and the _gdalinfo --version_ reports version **1.5.0** instead of **1.4.1**.





Here you can find Frank's instructions [how to grab new and correct package](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-announce/2007-April/000006.html) with GDAL 1.4.1.
