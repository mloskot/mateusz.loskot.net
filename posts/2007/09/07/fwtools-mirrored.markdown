Short announcement, today I set up small mirror for [FWTools](http://fwtools.maptools.org/) - Open Source GIS Binary Kit for Windows and Linux. It's available through HTTP under [http://fwtools.loskot.net](http://fwtools.loskot.net).




Recently, some users reported they have problems with accessing the main FWTools website from various countries, like China, so perhaps this mirror will help them to access the package without any problems.




Please, drop me a note if you've encountered problems with accessing the _fwtools.loskot.net_ server.





**Spread the FWTools!**

Added download statistics - [http://loskot.net/stats_fwtools.php](http://loskot.net/stats_fwtools.php)

I think it may be helpful if users know geographical location of the _fwtools.loskot.net_ mirror:
