[![GDAL logo](/images/logos/gdal-logo.png)](http://www.gdal.org/)Yesterday, [Frank](http://home.gdal.org/warmerda/) announced another milestone hit by [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/):

> Santa and the GDAL/OGR Project Team are pleased to announce the release of GDAL/OGR 1.5.0
> This is the first "new feature" release since the  GDAL 1.4.0 release approximately one year ago.

The new release brings a lot of new features and bug fixes. Just give some statistics:
  * more than **420** tickets closed on the [Trac](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/)
  * implemented **17** new GDAL drivers for [raster formats](http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html)
  * and **4** new OGR drivers for [vectors](http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr_formats.html)
  * implemented **4** (5 counting RFC 16) [RFC](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/RfcList) documents
  * added **5** new command line utilities
  * plus, **big** number of features and improvements in SWIG bindings for scripting languages

The complete and long list of changes can be found in the [1.5.0 Release News](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/Release/1.5.0-News).

The new GDAL/OGR 1.5.0 sources and a couple of additional packages can be found at [Download Source](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadSource#a1.5.0LatestStableRelease) website. There are also Windows 32-bit binaries available: [http://download.osgeo.org/gdal/win32/1.5/](http://download.osgeo.org/gdal/win32/1.5/)

On behalf of the GDAL/OGR Project Team, I'd like to send a **big thanks** to all developers, contributors and users involved in development of the 1.5.0 release for their great work and support, invaluable [bug reports](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/report) and [testing](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/TestMatrix150). And thanks to [Santa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus) too!
