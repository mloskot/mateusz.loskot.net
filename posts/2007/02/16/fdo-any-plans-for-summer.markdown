Thanks to [Jason Birch](http://www.jasonbirch.com/nodes/) recently [calling](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/fdo-internals/2007-February/000798.html) on the FDO developers [mailing list](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/fdo-internals/), it's getting loudly about idea of joining the [Google Summer of Code 2007](http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/02/speaking-of-summer.html) with [Feature Data Objects](http://fdo.osgeo.org/) project.




I strongly support Jason's idea because with SoC, Google is giving a great opportunity for [Open Source](http://code.google.com/projects.html) projects to [boost](http://www.refractions.net/soc2006/) their development and gain new features or [prototypes ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Prototyping)ready for next steps toward usability.







Jason posted a nice proposal of features for SoC. Here are my favorites:




  * [64-bit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit) platform support




FDO is not officially nor unofficially supported and as latest [reports](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/fdo-internals/2007-February/000799.html) indicate some substantial work is required.




  * [Command line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_interface) tools




I'm a big fun of GDAL and OGR command line utilities. I think it's a great idea about having similar tools for FDO: fdoinfo, fdo2fdo, etc. Having [ogr2ogr](http://gdal.osgeo.org/ogr/ogr2ogr.html) and fdo2fdo, a user would be able to pipe vector data in any direction :-). Another utility I'm thinking about is fdoinfo, FDO equivalent of [ogrinfo](http://gdal.osgeo.org/ogr/ogrinfo.html) from the OGR package.




  * [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) support




Yes, FDO is not supported on this platform. The SoC 2007 could be a nice opportunity to change this situation.









If you have any idea of new features you'd like to see in the Feature Data Objects, please propose them on the [fdo-internals](http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/fdo-internals) list or just put here as a comment and I'll forward them to the FDO team.





I'm wondering if there is any motion in [OSGeo](http://www.osgeo.org/) to become a [mentoring organization](http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=60290&topic=10732) for Google SoC and if such idea is reasonable in any way.
