My fianc√©e Pantera as has brand new [Apple iMac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_iMac) for sell. The machine was [released in 2008](http://support.apple.com/kb/SP485) and bought in July 2008. Pantera has used it for 3 days only and put it back to the cartoon box (boxes from Apple are really cool ;-)). It is standard specification: **Intel Core 2 Duo (2.8 GHz); 2 GB DDR2 SDRAM; HDD 320 GB**. We have left the machine in our apartment in Poland, but we can ship it internationally.





How much? It's the matter for negotiation but the prices is surely much lower than [average current price](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/offer-listing/B0018O6RG8/ref=dp_olp_0?ie=UTF8&condition=all).
