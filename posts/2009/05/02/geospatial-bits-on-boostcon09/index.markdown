On the 3rd of May 2009, the best event dedicated to C++ programmers starts in [Aspen](http://www.boostcon.com/location/around-town), US. It is [BoostCon'09](http://www.boostcon.com/). The conference gathers developers and users of [Boost C++ Libraries](http://boost.org/).




This year the event brings some flavour of geospatial technologies. [Barend Gehrels](http://www.boostcon.com/program/speakers#barend-gehrels) and [Bruno Lalande](http://www.boostcon.com/program/speakers#bruno-lalande) - core developers - are [presenting](http://www.boostcon.com/program/sessions#gehrels-lalande-a-generic-geometry-library) their [Generic Geometry Library](http://mateusz.loskot.net/?p=399) - 






  * a library for geometry and geography,


  * being agnostic in coordinate space and dimensions,


  * based on templates and static polymorphism,


  * [decoupling types from algorithms](http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/stl_introduction.html),


  * applying (self)verification of specified [requirements](http://www.boost.org/community/generic_programming.html#concept) with use of [concepts](http://www.boost.org/community/generic_programming.html#concept)




uff. :-)
