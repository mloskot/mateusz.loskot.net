[![Generic Geometry Library (GGL)](/images/logos/ggl-logo.png)](http://trac.osgeo.org/ggl/) Today, [Hartmut Kaiser](http://beta.boost.org/users/people/hartmut_kaiser.html), [manager](http://www.boost.org/community/review_schedule.html) of the [review](/?p=1530) of the [Generic Geometry Library](http://trac.osgeo.org/ggl/), [announced](http://lists.boost.org/boost-announce/2009/11/0245.php) the official results of the review.





Here we go:





> Formally this review ended with 12 YES and 2 NO votes. This result reflects the overall discussion and the general consensus of this library being worth to be included into [Boost](http://www.boost.org/).


 


It means that formally the Generic Geometry Library has been approved to become a part of [Boost C++ Libraries](http://www.boost.org/libs/) collection. Happy day!

I would like to send out my own kudos to Barend Gehrels and Bruno Lalande, the very core team, who started the project, designed and implemented the high-quality library and eventually released it as Open Source Software.
