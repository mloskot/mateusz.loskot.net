[![Boost C++ Libraries](/images/logos/boost-logo.png)](http://www.boost.org) Continuing [today's topic of computational geometry](/?p=1457), I'm happy to forward one more news from the Boost Community. On November 5th, 2009, after conducting the process of [formal review](http://lists.boost.org/boost-announce/2009/08/0234.php), [Fernando Cacciola](http://www.scisoft-consulting.com/) - the review manager - [announced](http://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2009/11/157967.php) that [Boost C++ Libraries](http://www.boost.org/) officially accepted [Boost.Polygon](http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/gtl/doc/index.htm) library to its collection. The Boost.Polygon is developed by Lucanus Simonson with support by [Intel Corporation](http://www.intel.com/).





See Fernando's message [Boost.Polygon library accepted into boost](http://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2009/11/157967.php).





I suppose it will be released in Boost version following the [upcoming 1.41.0](http://beta.boost.org/users/news/version_1_41_0).
