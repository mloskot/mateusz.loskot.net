[Paul](http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/) has [announced](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/tosprint/2009-November/000079.html) preparation for second edition of OSGeo [TOSprint](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Toronto_Code_Sprint_2009) event. This year edition is called [New Year Code Sprint](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/New_York_Code_Sprint_2010).





<del>I'm looking for a sponsorship for return ticket for flight from London to New York + one extra large [Hawaiana pizza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_pizza) (ham replaced with tuna, please) per day of coding. I can offer decent C/C++ programming skills. I can write code for up to 16 hours a day (preferably on [libLAS](http://liblas.org/) and [WKT Raster](http://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/wiki/WKTRaster) :-)). I like fixing bugs. Interested sponsors, please [contact](/contact/) me as soon as possible, due to the visa requirements I have to sort out to be able to enter the gates of heaven. (I'm Polish. Nobody likes them, neither Uncle Sam.)</del>
