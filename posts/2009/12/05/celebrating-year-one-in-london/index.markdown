I arrived to [London](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/sets/72157607312527439/) in the small hours on [Friday December 5, 2008](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events/2008_December_5). My better half [Pantera](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/tags/pantera) joined me on [December 22, 2008](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events/2008_December_22).





On Monday, [December 8, 2009](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events/2009_December_22) I'll be celebrating year one of great time, hacking and company at [Cadcorp](http://www.cadcorp.com/).
