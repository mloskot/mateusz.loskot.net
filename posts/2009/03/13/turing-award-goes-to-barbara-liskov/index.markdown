Learning principles of [Object-Oriented Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), one of the first and very important thing to understand is a definition of [subtype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtype). It's usually not a big problem to explain it correctly and there are a few descriptions dangling around.





Of course, I have my favourite definition of the relation between supertype and subtype. It is called [Liskov Substitution Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle). The LSP reveals existing subtleties that may make understanding of the term of subtype not easy. There is a well-known example presenting potential problems: _a squere is a rectangle_ or may be it is not? Robert Martin has written more about in [C++ Report](http://www.adtmag.com/joop/index.aspx) long time ago ([PDF](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/lsp.pdf)). For a [C++ programmer](http://www.research.att.com/~bs/C++.html), like myself - who cares about [design by contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract) (DbC) - the Liskov Substitution Principle is helpful to understand role of [pre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precondition)-/[post](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcondition)-conditions in [inheritance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(computer_science)).





The Liskov Substitution Principle was formulated by Professor Barbara Liskov ([MIT](http://www.mit.edu/)). Two days ago, BBC announced as follows:





> The 2009 A. M. Turing Award has gone to Barbara Liskov for her contributions to programming.

Congratulations!
