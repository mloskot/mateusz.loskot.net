Another video from [BoostCon'09](http://www.boostcon.com/) conference. This time it is about the [Geometry Template Library](http://blip.tv/file/2540933) (GTL) for [STL-like](http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/) 2D operations by Lucanus Simonson and Gyuszi Suto:









[Here](http://www.boostcon.com/site-media/var/sphene/sphwiki/attachment/2009/05/01/GTL.pdf) is PDF document with slides from the conference talk. The GTL library was submitted to [Boost](http://www.boost.org) C++ Libraries for [formal review](http://lists.boost.org/boost-announce/2009/08/0234.php) as [Boost Polygon](http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/gtl/doc/index.htm) library. Performance was at large a significant subject of posted reviews and discussions. [Barend and Bruno](http://geometrylibrary.geodan.nl/) from [Generic Geometry Library](http://trac.osgeo.org/ggl/) (GGL) have been working hard to build a comprehensive performance study of [Open Source geometry libraries](http://tsusiatsoftware.net/jts/jts-links.html) available on the market. Results and source code are [available](http://trac.osgeo.org/ggl/wiki/Performance).
