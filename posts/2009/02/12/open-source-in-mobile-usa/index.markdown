I've just spotted there is an upcoming event in March 2009 about Open Source initiatives in Mobile world: [Open Source in Mobile, USA](http://usa.osimworld.com/ ). I've taken a short look at the agenda and there seems to be nothing related to geospatial solutions. Nevertheless, it's always good to see number of other FOSS-oriented foundations like GNOME, Mozilla and OSI meeting big enterprise players on the same field.
