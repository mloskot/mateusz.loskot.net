Tomorrow early morning I'm leaving to Nottingham to attend the [OSGIS UK 2009](http://www.opensourcegis.org.uk/) conference. It's been long time since [FOSS4G 2007](http://2007.foss4g.org/) and I didn't make it to [Cape Town](http://conference.osgeo.org/index.php/foss4g/2008) last year, so I'm looking forward to meet FOSS4G and OSGeo folks in UK.





A few minutes ago, Suchith Anand [announced](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2009-June/005457.html) there will be live streaming transmission available from OSGIS sessions. This is cool!





By the way, does anyone remember a kind of pioneer transmission from [FOSS4G 2006](http://foss4g2006.org/) in Lausanne? The videos are [still linked](http://foss4g2006.org/internalPage.py?pageId=21&confId=1) but seem to be unavailable. Pity. It would be cool to archive them somewhere on [foss4g.org](http://conference.osgeo.org/).
