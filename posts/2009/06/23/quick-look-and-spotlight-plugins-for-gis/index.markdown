I had been thinking about developing something like that since I started to use [Mac OS X](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/2053393609/) as my development environment, but [I left my Apple boxes at home in PL](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/2053396495/) and now I've switched back to [Linux](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/1558750896/) (you simply can't forget your roots :-)) . So, the idea has been swapped in the abyss of my mind until I accidentally came across [GISLook](http://jenny.cartography.ch/gislook/) five minutes ago:





> GISLook and GISMeta are plugins for Mac OS X 10.5 that show GIS data in the Finder.





These cool-looking plugins were created by [Bernhard Jenny](http://jenny.cartography.ch/). 


I know many GIS users loving products of the <del>forbidden</del> fruit, so I'm spreading the word about these nice looking and, hopefully, well working tools.
