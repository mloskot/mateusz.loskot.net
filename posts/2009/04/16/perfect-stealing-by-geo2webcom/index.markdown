[I am pissed off](/?p=413) on what Mr [Pavel L.](http://whois.domaintools.com/geo2web.com) is doing by **stealing** tons of content of geospatial blogs around the world. As a big fun of [Don Quixote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote), I decided to try to reach this guy by registering to his _passing off_ geo2web site and submit a bunch of comments below posts he has **stolen** from my own website.





The result? No result. And, as expected Mr Pavel has **removed** all my comments within an hours as well as he **blocked** my _mloskot_ account in geo2web.com.





As a really big fun of _Don Quixote_, I probably will try to call on his phone kindly asking him to find another and legal way of becoming a _geospatial celebrity_.





_I don't like chickens_
