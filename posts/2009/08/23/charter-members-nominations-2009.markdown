The [OSGeo](http://osgeo.org) Foundation [Chief Returning Officer](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Chief_Returning_Officer) (CRO) has posted [new nominations](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/New_Member_Nominations_2009) to OSGeo [Charter Members](http://www.osgeo.org/charter_members).





Personally, I'm glad to see Robert Szczepanek from Poland listed among other noble members of [OSGeo Community](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Category:OSGeo_Member). Robert has played an important & leading role in [FOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software) and [FOSS4G](http://foss4g.org/) advocacy, education and development in our Polish yard for long time:





  * [Robert](http://robert.szczepanek.pl/) has been an active member of OSGeo community and contributor to projects like [Quantum GIS](http://www.qgis.org/) and [GRASS](http://www.osgeo.org/grass/) for long time, and recently also involved in [gvSIG](http://www.osgeo.org/gvsig/) project. He is a mover and leader of [Polish Translations](http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Manual_Translation) of UI of all the three projects, with help from other Polish members Milena Nowatorska and [Borys Jurgiel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXyjWWneDpY). By the way, check [Borys' plugins](http://bwj.aster.net.pl/). He also translates Quantum GIS manual and prepares [Polish versions of press releases](http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Press_Release_Announcements). Robert also initiated his own [project](http://www.szczepanek.pl/icons.grass/v.0.1/) called [GIS icons theme](http://robert.szczepanek.pl/icons.php).


  * In education, Robert [authored](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Educational_Content_Inventory#Quantum_GIS_tutorial_-_Kurs_Quantum_GIS) [complete course for new adepts of GIS](http://robert.szczepanek.pl/qgis_tutorial.php). The course is purely based on Open Source software (including QGIS and GRASS. Robert also encourages his students, to make [dissertations based or about FOSS4G and Open Standards](http://holmes.iigw.pl/~rszczepa/dyplomy.php), and with success.




It's a good news for OSGeo Community in [Poland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland).
