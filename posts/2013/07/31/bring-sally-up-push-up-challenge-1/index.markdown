Yesterday near the end of climbing session at the 
[Castle Climbing](http://www.castle-climbing.co.uk/), I had a quick chat with 
[Gaz Parry](http://www.gazparryclimbing.com) about some crazy bodyweight exercises.

Gaz was talking about this curious challenge of push-ups performed along
Moby's song called "Flower" where push-up reps are controlled by the phrase
*Bring Sally Up, Bring Sally Down...*

I was getting hooked, then Gaz mentioned a video on YouTube with someone performing
variation of this challenge, not on floor but on three medicine balls.
The famous strong man turns out to be Lee Tiffin from the 
[Black Sheep Fitness Academy](http://www.blacksheepfitnessacademy.com).

> "I can do that, Hold my beer!"

Obviously, I had to tried it myself. Here is footage of my first attempt to the 
Bring Sally Up Push Up Challenge in which I fail miserably :)

I only endured ~50% of the overall time :$
I've stood corrected about where is my place
and #humble me goes back to training *\0/*

                                           I'll be back!
