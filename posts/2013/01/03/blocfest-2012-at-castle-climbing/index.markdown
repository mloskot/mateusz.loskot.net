It's been more than three weeks since last round of the [Blocfest](http://www.blocfest.co.uk/)
bouldering competition. It took place on the 8th of December, 2012 at the Castle Climbing
in London. A wrap-up summary should be posted earlier, but I've been lazy (training hard,
writing little) and the Christmas break kept me busy shopping, cooking and driving.
Finally, developing of the hundreds of Blocfest photos taken by Pantera took me ages.

It was my first Blocfest round and second round of the Blocfest 2012/2013 edition.
So, my memories are fresh as from yesterday, about almost every problem I attempted.
I have a a few bouldering competitions behind my belt (SIBL, King of the Mezz, CWIF)
and in most cases I systematically scored similar profile of sends: 50% of problems
flashed and that was it.
The last Blocfest round seems to be a bit different and I'm hopeful this was due to 
three months of systematic and *structured* training at the Arch and the Castle.
At least, I did feel stronger and more solid on than during the previous competitions.

The last Blocfest also proved to me that friendly bouldering comps make a fantastic
opportunity to benchmark myself and observe changes not only in physical performance
but mental too. It also fuels up the motivation tanks for weeks of training to come.

Long story short, I managed to flash 16 of 25 beautifully bolted-on Blocfest problems,
then I sent another 4 in second go what makes 20 problems done in total.
According to the comp rules, the math is this:

```
  160 = 16 x 10 points for top in flash
+  28 =  4 x  7 points for top in second go
--------
  188 points scored of total 250 points available
```

Although not a top notch achivement comparing to the top three male contenders:
Jon Partridge, Marcin franiak and Matt Cousins who completed the qualifier with more
than 230 points, I tend to dream that my score has a potential value of 200 points.
Sweet dream! Then, after the existing finals first place on the podium went to
[Ondrej Nevelik](http://nevelik.name/), who has been taking the London scene of
bouldering comps by the storm recently.

Kudos to the [Blocfest Team](http://www.blocfest.co.uk/p/the-team.html) for their hard work. Quality bouldering arrived to South East!

During the competition at the Castle, Pantera was very busy visiting all the corners of the event
and capturing the moments of fun and effort, focus and sweat.
