![OpenID logo](/images/logos/openid-logo.png)On May 8th, Ross Turk [posted](http://sourceforge.net/community/openid-and-good-citizenship/) on the SourceForge.net community blog: _Hey! So Iâll just blurt it out: weâve joined the OpenID Foundation!_. As Ross confirms, [OpenID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID) use is becoming very popular, means users like the idea of _decentralized, free and open standard that lets users control the amount of personal information they provide_.




In the initial [announcement](http://sourceforge.net/community/openid-on-sourceforgenet/) about the OpenID idea, SF.net stuff revealed they use OpenID [implementation](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.openid.html) from [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/) - Open Source Software (oh yeah!) available under BSD License.





Recently, I've noticed that [Chris brought the idea of OpenID](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/sac/2007-July/000719.html) to OSGeo year ago and [setup](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/sac/2007-July/000725.html) necessary [infrastructure](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OpenID), so [OSGeo userid can be used as an openid](http://www.osgeo.org/osgeo_userid).





I tried today to use OpenID capabilities of OSGeo User ID, but [without any luck](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/sac/2008-May/001290.html). It seems like the service has been disabled or moved without update in docs. Anyway, I hope we are going to keep it running. Hmm, it's unclear to me if the OSGeo User ID is supposed to work as an OpenID and allow OSGeo users to authenticate to external non-OSGeo services with it, like to SourceForge.net. Is it?.





I'm wondering if it would be reasonable and beneficial the [OSGeo Foundation](http://osgeo.org/) participates in activities lead by the [OpenID Foundation](http://openid.net/foundation/). What about joining the OpenID Foundation as a non-profit organization?
