![Cascados Logo](/images/logos/cascados-logo.png)A few weeks ago, [CASCADOSS](http://www.cascadoss.eu/) project leaders requested for patronage from the [OSGeo Foundation](http://osgeo.org/) for [two upcoming events](http://mateusz.loskot.net/2008/02/12/the-cascadoss-project/): International Symposium and International Information Workshop. The request was approved and final decision was made during the [36th OSGeo Board Meeting](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Thirty_Sixth_Board_Meeting).





Yesterday, Frank Warmerdam officially announced this fact in the OSGeo News: [OSGeo Supports CASCADOSS](http://www.osgeo.org/node/702)





Detailed document describing the [Support for CASCADOSS](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Support_for_CASCADOSS) is available on the [OSGeo Wiki](http://wiki.osgeo.org), together with body of letter of support. Printed copy of the letter was sent to the CASCADOSS project leaders.
