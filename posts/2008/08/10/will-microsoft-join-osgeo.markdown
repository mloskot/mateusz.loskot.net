Microsoft joined the [O'Reilly's Open Source Convention](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/) (OSCON) this year. Why? Because Free and Open Source Software development is [anti-American cancer](http://www.linux.com/feature/143771) and [an intellectual-property destroyer](http://www.oreillynet.com/manila/tim/stories/storyReader$167). It does seem _pretty logical_, doesn't it ;-)





Last Thursday, Microsoft [announced](http://www.gmanews.tv/story/112115/Microsoft-launches-open-source-lab-in-RP) they plan to launch Open Source Lab in the Philippines in September 2008. The company officials promised:





> It will be open to open source and cross-platform enthusiasts, including students, professionals, companies and users groups





Also during OSCON 2008, Microsoft [pledged](http://port25.technet.com/archive/2008/07/25/oscon2008.aspx) annual donation of $100,000 USD  to the [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/) becoming platinum sponsor of Apache development.





These are not the first "positive" initiatives by Microsoft targeting Open Source Software. They have [Linux Interoperability Lab](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/sep07/09-11MSNovellLabsPR.mspx) and an [Open Source Software Lab](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2005/aug05/08-10OpenSourceLab.mspx) already running. The general idea is to collaborate with non-profit open source groups around the world.





Will [OSGeo](http://www.osgeo.org/) be one of these groups?
