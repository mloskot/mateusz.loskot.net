This is a short post spreading the announcement about upcoming [RMA 2008](http://rma2008.wl.sggw.pl/) conference. The RMA 2008 is the **2008 World Conference on Natural Resource Modeling**. It will be held at the [Warsaw University of Life Sciences](http://www.sggw.pl/) (SGGW), Warsaw, Poland, June 15-18, 2008.



> The conference will provide a forum for the presentation of recent progress in the use of modeling techniques to help in the understanding and managing of complex natural resource systems








The call for papers has been [opened](http://rma2008.wl.sggw.pl/call/) very recently and not yet widely announced. As I've been told by organizers, it's possible to present applications and software packages related to the conference matter. I've been wondering if there would be anyone from the OSGeo Community interested to present FOSS solutions for environmental related problems.





By the way, RMA 2008 is planned on the same week as [Cascadoss](/2008/02/12/the-cascadoss-project/) symposium and workshop. So, there is some chance to visit both events.
