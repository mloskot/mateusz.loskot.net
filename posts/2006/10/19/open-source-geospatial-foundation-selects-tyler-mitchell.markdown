Five minutes ago, I received a great announcement saying the OSGeo hired Tyler Mitchell as an executive director:



> Seattle, Washington, Oct. 19, 2006- The Open Source Geospatial Foundation, or OSGeo, today announced that Tyler Mitchell has been hired as its new executive director. Mitchell-who has a decade of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) experience as an Analyst, Manager, open source advocate and author-will be responsible for the Foundation's day-to-day operations, supporting development and promotion.










Here is the official news about it - [Open Source Geospatial Foundation Selects Tyler Mitchell, Open Source Advocate, as Executive Director](https://www.osgeo.org/content/news/news_archive/tyler_ed.html)






I'm absolutely happy of Tyler's nomination!
