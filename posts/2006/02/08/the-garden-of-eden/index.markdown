Yesterday, I read on the [CNN.com](http://cnn.com) about revelation from [Foja mountains](http://local.google.com/?t=h&ll=-3.272146,138.592529&spn=5.284909,10.305176&t=h) in [Indonesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia):



> Scientists said on Tuesday that they had found a "Lost World" in an Indonesian mountain jungle, home to dozens of exotic new species of birds, butterflies, frogs and plants.









It seems to be really the _Lost World_. Scientists found there dozens of previously unknown species of plants and animals:




	
  * new bird species - honeyeater bird with a bright orange patch on its face

	
  * 20 new species of frog - including a very small one less than 14 mm long

	
  * 4 new species of butterfly

	
  * 5 new species of palms

	
  * Rhododendrom flower which seems to be the largest ever found - 15 cm across

That's really amazing and the best news I could get before my breakfast today! In the days you hear about extinction of species of animals and plants, clear-cutting of rainforests or polluted air and see such news about _Lost World_ is really a **bracing news**, isn't it?

Here are images I saved from GE so you can look where is _The Garden of Eden_:
