[![Mike Hall - Windows CE and Windows Embedded Lab Tour](http://scrat.members.winisp.net/Channel9/10924.jpg)](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=10924)Recently, when I was roistering on [Mike Hall's Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/mikehall/) I found a page on which Mike lists all [MSDN Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com) Embedded and Mobile [videos in one place](http://scrat.members.winisp.net/Channel9/Channel9Videos.htm).






Mike announces new **Chris Muench video** which currently is in the MSDN Channel 9 queue:


> I was talking with Chris Muench from Siemens a few days ago, we recorded a video for MSDN Channel 9 on Direct3D programming - one of the comments Chris makes in the video is how "new" developers are only being taught the higher level development languages (Java/C#/VB) without knowing lower level languages which bring you closer to the hardware and also help you better understand what's happening in the system.
