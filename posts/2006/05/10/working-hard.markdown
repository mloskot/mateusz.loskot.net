Recently, I was not very active on my blog. There are two reasons of that silence: small holidays - I spent last week with my parents (visiting my home after about 1.5.year :-)), second, I'm contributing to [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org) project most of my time. I'm also trying to contribute to [MapServer](http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu) ...so there is huge amount of things I have to learn. In the meantime, I'm investigating [OSGeo](http://www.osgeo.org) projects like [FDO](https://fdo.osgeo.org) or [MapGuide](https://mapguide.osgeo.org) and trying to continue my participation in [GEOS](http://geos.refractions.net) project. I'm also trying to provide substantial support to GDAL/[OGR](http://www.gdal.org/ogr/) users (e.g. regarding [Windows CE port of OGR](http://http://www.gdal.org/wince.html)) on mailing lists and #gdal IRC channel.




Hopefully, I'll spend next 2-3 months (may be more) working with [Open Source GIS](https://www.osgeo.org) projects. Recently, I started to think about new web mapping project. I am going to develop it using [MapServer](http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu), [WFS](http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/docs/howto/wfs_server) and [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX). I hope I'll find some time to start it. Although, I'm a web mapping solutions newbie, I'm not affraid at all because [Tyler's book](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/webmapping/) is laying on my desk.






...I'm back to work.
