[![ATL Internals cover image](http://www.informit.com/ShowCover.asp?isbn=0321159624&type=c)](http://www.informit.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0321159624)Every programmer using [ATL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Template_Library) and [WTL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Template_Library) knows that [ATL Internals](http://www.informit.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0321159624) is a must-read book providing comprehensive background information about [ATL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vccore/html/_atl_ATL_Article_Overview.asp).





ATL is my favourite [library](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_%28computer_science%29) to use as a base for [Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) development. It helps to solve [wide variety of problems](http://www.codeproject.com/atl/), on both sides: client and server, especially strongly simplifies creation of [COM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model) components. ATL-based binaries are very small and robust. ATL is also an underlaying layer for WTL which is a [GUI toolkit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_toolkit), light-weight and modern alternative to [MFC](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kkcb3t0w.aspx).






From [C++ language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) perspective, ATL is designed using modern C++ techniques and intensively uses [template metaprogramming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming) paradigm. One of the base concept used in ATL is the [Curiously Recurring Template Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_Recurring_Template_Pattern) (CRTP). Next pattern based on the CRTP is Upside-Down Inheritance, very well explained in the [ATL and Upside-Down Inheritance](http://www.apostate.com/programming/atlupsidedown.html) article.





I'd like to encourage everyone serious about Windows programming in C++ to learn ATL and WTL.
