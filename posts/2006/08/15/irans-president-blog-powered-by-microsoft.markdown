I'm not a politics fun at all and when I launched this website I decided to not to talk about politics here. However yet, I can't abstain from post something funny, or may be sad. You will judge if you want.




Today, I read in one of polish newspaper about Iran's President started his own blog a few days ago. Here is the blog address [http://www.ahmadinejad.ir](http://www.ahmadinejad.ir). So, I decided to see what he is writing there about. I have to say, it's professionally designed and, as I suppose, it uses nice [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX) stuff.





I also decided to find out who webmastered Iran's President Blog, what company etc. Here is what I saw in the HTML header of the main page source code:

    
    
    <meta content="Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 7.1" name="GENERATOR">
    <meta content="Visual Basic .NET 7.1" name="CODE_LANGUAGE">
    <meta content="http://schemas.microsoft.com/intellisense/ie5" name="vs_targetSchema">
    


Interesting, isn't it:-) You can check it yourself if you want, by looking at the source code (CTRL+U in [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/))




AFAIK USA is Iran's major enemy of all _[unbelievers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad)_ around the world and [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) is [the USA company](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/insidefacts_ms.mspx#ER). So, isn't Iran's President Blog a proof of [hypocrisy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy) and a kind of double-dealing that politics [1] show us every single day? I'm pretty sure this applies to all politics, no matter from what country, party or religion they come.




I'm quite sensitive for hipocrisy, especially that based on religion. Yes, I see it quite often in [Poland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland) where I live now. I'm well experienced with polish ultra-nationalists gangs wearing boots made by [Dr. Martens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Martens) (german!) and [reversible flight jacket](http://www.alphaindustries.com/alphastory_ma1history.aspx) (called _flejers_ in polish slang)) which is used by United States Air Force and Navy pilots (made by USA!)....this all is about hypocrisy.




### Disclaimer




I hope this is last time I'm writing about politics. I want to tell you I'm completely neutral and tolerant regarding people's opinions, faith, confidence, race, fencies, etc.  I'm only against every ultra ideas, as they are very dangerous. Hipocrysy is only an instrument to make a good impression in this quaggy bussines.
