Friends from [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) has put [video with lecture](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/interface-versioning-in-c-plus-plus/zx-553) about [Interface Versioning in C++](http://accu.org/index.php/accu_branches/accu_london/accu_london_oct_2010) given by Steve Love last Thursday. The lecture was organised by London chapater of [ACCU](http://accu.org/).


Generally, Steve addressed problems of the [DLL Hell ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_hell) and ABI compatibility proposing a not-so-simple, but applicable and usable solution for number of most common problems. Along the video, slides are also available, so it should be easy to grasp the idea.


I've received copy of Steve's code and I'm preparing a few more tests which I hope to describe in details and post here soon.
