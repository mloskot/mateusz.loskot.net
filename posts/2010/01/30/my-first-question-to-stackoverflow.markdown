Recently, I've got a bit sucked in by the [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) and [related communities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow). Even if I don't completely understand how it is supposed to be different to my favourite _old-school-but-still-the-best_ communication channels to share knowledge, meaning [Usenet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) and [mailing lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailing_list). _Web X.Y generally sucks!_ I never liked the idea of [Web discussion boards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum) - doesn't feel [user-friendly](http://www.userfriendly.org/) for me at all and it's way more time consuming to participate in discussions on such boards than in mailing lists. The idea of [StackOverflow  works for me](http://http://stackoverflow.com/users/151641/mloskot), somehow. A couple of times I got sucked quite deeply and stole two or three ours of my sleep to take the challenge, to [benchmark my brain](http://www.brainbench.com/) a bit.


After lurking and kicking my own axons, it's time to nudge [stackoverflowers](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/03/02/stackoverflow-reputation-statistics/) with my first question. Here we go:

[Which macro to wrap Mac OS X specific code in C/C++](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2166483/which-macro-to-wrap-mac-os-x-specific-code-in-c-c)
