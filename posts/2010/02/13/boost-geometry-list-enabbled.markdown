For those who are interested in the subject and prefer Web-based discussion forums, I added the [Boost Geometry](http://trac.osgeo.org/ggl/) (aka GGL) [mailing list](http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/ggl) to the Nabble as [Boost Geometry](http://n3.nabble.com/Boost-Geometry-f203548.html) forum.


Update: Thanks to Hugo from Nabble for importing all archives of the ggl mailing list.


Update 2: Archive moved to [http://boost-geometry.203548.n3.nabble.com](http://boost-geometry.203548.n3.nabble.com/)
