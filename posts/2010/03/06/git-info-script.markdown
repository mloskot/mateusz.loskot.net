As a long time user of [Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/), I've got used to use of [svn info](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.2/svn.ref.svn.c.info.html) command. Since I started drifting to [Git](http://git-scm.com/) system, I've missed this command pretty much until I found [git-info script crafted by Duane Johnson](http://blog.inquirylabs.com/2008/06/12/git-info-kinda-like-svn-info/)





Kudos to Duane! And, I suggest any SVN user who reincarnated as Git user to grab and try it.
