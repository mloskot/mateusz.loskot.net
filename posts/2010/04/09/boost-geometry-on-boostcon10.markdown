[![Boost Geometry (aka Generic Geometry Library, GGL)](/images/logos/ggl-logo.png)](http://trac.osgeo.org/ggl/)[Boost.Geometry talk](http://www.boostcon.com/program/sessions#gehrels-lalande-loskot-generic-programming-for-geometry) is [scheduled](http://www.boostcon.com/program) for [BoostCon'10](http://www.boostcon.com/) conference. Thanks to [Barend Gehrels](http://barendgehrels.blogspot.com/), [Boost.Geometry](http://trac.osgeo.org/ggl/) team will be represented on the conference.





In spite of the fact I'm [listed as a speaker](http://www.boostcon.com/program/speakers) for [BoostCon'10](http://www.boostcon.com/), I will not attend this amazing event. I've planned to be there, I can't make it this year, unfortunately.
