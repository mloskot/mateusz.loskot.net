[Linux.com](http://www.linux.com/) published an interesting article - a tutorial - about famous components of Free and Open Source Software [stack](http://osgeo.org/) for [Web Mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_mapping). Justin Palk, the author, gives a very accessible introduction to building Web Mapping solution using [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/), [PostGIS](http://postgis.refractions.net/) and [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/). I think it's a great writing for anyone who takes first steps in [Web Mapping with FOSS4G](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596008659/).
