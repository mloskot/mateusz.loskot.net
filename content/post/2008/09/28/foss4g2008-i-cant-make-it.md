...school, **job**, trips, move, army, **school**, move, **new job**...lots of things have been happening in my life with speed of light, so I've had to change most of my plans, especially those about traveling. And, I can't make it to attend the [FOSS4G 2008](http://foss4g2008.org/) conference.





Nevertheless, I'm still listed next to two positions of the conference program and that's correct. I planned to help [Frank Warmerdam](http://home.gdal.org/warmerda/) during the [Raster Processing and Preparation with GDAL](http://conference.osgeo.org/index.php/foss4g/2008/paper/view/186) workshop and to give one presentation - [Introduction to ASPRS LAS data processing with libLAS](http://conference.osgeo.org/index.php/foss4g/2008/paper/view/362).





Apparently, I won't be able to assist Frank during the workshop - _I'm sorry Frank!_ and I'm crossing my fingers for you. And, the [libLAS](http://liblas.org/) presentation will be given by...[Frank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Warmerdam) - crossing my fingers harder :-) Originally, I promised Frank I will provide him with presentation slides and I'll be a virtual assistant. Actually, I failed even with that :-(





Fortunately, [Hobu](http://hobu.biz/) took over this task and prepared [PDF document](http://liblas.org/attachment/wiki/WikiStart/liblas_foss4g_2008.pdf) with a set of fantastic slides. Frank and Howard have really saved my ass and I'd like to send them **[veeery big thanks](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/2703954502/in/set-72157606383757421/)**!





I regret I can't come to Cape Town, to experience the [fantastic atmosphere](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/foss4g2008/), to see [hundreds](http://flickr.com/photos/mloskot/sets/72157602164119884/) [geogeeks](http://flickr.com/photos/mloskot/sets/72157602220451475/) together, to have a [great](http://flickr.com/photos/mloskot/1438143120/in/set-72157602143647405/) [time](http://flickr.com/photos/mloskot/1438142262/in/set-72157602143647405/) with friends and to drink [a little too much beer with Tim](http://flickr.com/photos/mloskot/1438144922/in/set-72157602143647405/). See you guys in [Sydney, 2009](http://foss4g2009.org/)!
