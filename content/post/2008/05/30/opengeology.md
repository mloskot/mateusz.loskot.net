[![](/images/logos/opengeology-pl-logo.gif)](http://opengeology.pl/)From time to time, Google helps me to find and get new _treasures_ laying deep on the Internet. Today, it dug out [OpenGeology.pl](http://opengeology.pl/) website. Apparently, it has been launched quite recently and Google [reports](http://www.google.com/search?q=opengeology.pl) very few references about it. Because it's mostly in Polish language and English version is incomplete, I will give a short overview of it here. So, what is this website about?





The front page explains it very well:


> The **OpenGeology.pl** is devoted to the applications of [Open Source Software](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php) in [Geology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology)





Later, one can browse various resources organized by topic - reviews of Open Source Software, tutorials ie. on [DEM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model) processing and 3D technologies in geology as well as collection of free and public geodata. [DEM of Poland](http://opengeology.pl/index.php?act=category&sub=view&category_id=16) based on the [SRTM-3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission) is available through a friendly map-based interface in two alternative [coordinate systems](http://spatialreference.org/) ([WGS 84](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/) and [PUWG 92](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/2180/)) and three grid formats. It's worth to notice that _holes_ in original DEM files have been patched. I've not played with this data myself but it sounds very promising.





Now, let's get to the point - the software. And here, my eyes saw a nice list of [FOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS) packages, including [OSGeo Foundation](http://osgeo.org/) projects...[_and there was much rejoicing_](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/A/and-there-was-much-rejoicing.html).




OpenGeology community (see below) has found following FOSS4G and OSGeo projects useful: [GRASS](http://opengeology.pl/index.php?act=category&sub=view&category_id=34), [Open Source Software Image Map](http://opengeology.pl/index.php?act=category&sub=details&id=70) (OSSIM), [Quantum GIS](http://opengeology.pl/index.php?act=category&sub=details&id=56), [GDAL/OGR](http://opengeology.pl/index.php?act=category&sub=details&id=69) and [FWTools](http://opengeology.pl/index.php?act=category&sub=details&id=28).





A couple of words about the OpenGeology.pl authors. If my understanding is correct, the website was founded by [Polish Geological Institute](http://www.pgi.gov.pl/pgi_en/) and [Maciej Tomaszczyk](http://www.opengeology.pl/index.php?act=author&sub=details&id=7) is the main author and content provider. Kudos to the [OpenGeology.pl](http://opengeology.pl/) _Community_ for their efforts to spread the FOSS4G in Poland.
