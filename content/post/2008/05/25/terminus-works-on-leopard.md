[![terminus-font-1-macosx-10.5 by mloskot, on Flickr](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2345/2518098459_92dc4c2120_t.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/2518098459/)This is just a short post reporting that [Terminus](http://www.is-vn.bg/hamster/jimmy-en.html) font works on Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) very well.




In my old post [Terminus, my eyes saver](http://mateusz.loskot.net/?p=223/), there is more information on Terminus font, with pointers to where to get it and how to install it.
