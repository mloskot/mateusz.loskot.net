By the beginning of the year 2009, new must-read book for C++ hackers is rolling around. Anthony Williams is writing book titled: [C++ Concurrency in Action](http://www.manning.com/williams/) (ISBN: 1933988770):



> I will be covering all aspects of multithreaded programming with the new [C++0x](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x) standard, from the details of the new [C++0x](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2705.html) memory model and atomic operations to managing threads and designing parallel algorithms and thread-safe containers. The book will also feature a complete reference to the C++0x Standard Thread Library.

Since June, Anthony's book is available through Manning Early Access Program. The final release is planned on February 2009.





In the meantime, Anthony has published an article [Simpler Multithreading in C++0x](http://www.devx.com/SpecialReports/Article/38883) introducing multithreading support and thread library as a new feature in the [C++0x](http://herbsutter.wordpress.com/2007/02/07/iso-c0x-complete-public-review-draft-in-october-2007/trackback/) standard.
