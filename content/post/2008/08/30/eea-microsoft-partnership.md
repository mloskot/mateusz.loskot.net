It is 3 months old news, but I've found it very recently. In the middle of May 2008, [European Environment Agency](http://www.eea.europa.eu/) [announced](http://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/eea-and-microsoft-will-bring-environmental-information-to-your-fingertips) they [signed a partnership](http://www.microsoft.com/emea/presscentre/pressreleases/14052008_EEAClarityVision.mspx) with [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com). The aim of this collaboration is (or was) to create ''an environmental information platform'' based on Microsoft's [Virtual Earth](http://www.microsoft.com/VirtualEarth/).





In July 2008, EEA/Microsoft [launched](http://www.microsoft.com/emea/presscentre/pressreleases/WaterWatchPR_30072008.mspx) [Eye on Earth](http://www.eyeonearth.eu/) platform with Water Watch component combining scientific data and Web Mapping to present water quality in European countries: 


> Currently, it includes information on the water quality for more than 21.000 bathing sites throughout Europe
