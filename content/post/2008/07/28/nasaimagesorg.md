[NASA Images](http://nasaimages.org/) is





> a non-profit library, to offer public access to NASA's images, videos and audio collections





I'm not sure when it was launched, but [PC Authorities](http://www.pcauthority.com.au/) magazine [announced it](http://www.pcauthority.com.au/News/117915,nasa-opens-up-space-image-library.aspx) a few days ago. Regardless, there is a great set of interesting images of Our Mother Earth, Solar System and more.
