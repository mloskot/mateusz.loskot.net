Daniel shortly introduced the OpenAerialMap project and compared to the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) initiative. There are also w few notes about OAM future plans based on [Chris](http://crschmidt.net/)' [posts](http://www.linux.com/feature/125258) to the project mailing lists.





Kudos to Daniel for informing Polish FOSS communities about the OAM project.
