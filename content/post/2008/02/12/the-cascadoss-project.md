![Cascados Logo](/images/logos/cascados-logo.png)In this post, I'm going to spread a word about the [Cascados](http://www.cascadoss.eu/) project. The project is founded by the [European Commission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission) in frame of the [Sixth Framework Programme](http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp6/index_en.cfm) and is focused on development of _a trans-national cascade training programme on **Open Source GIS** & Remote Sensing software for environmental applications_. The **Cascados** project is formed by a number of [partners](http://www.cascadoss.eu/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3&Itemid=4) from Belgium, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.  More detailed information can be found on the project website (multilingual) recently launched at the [http://cascadoss.eu/](http://cascadoss.eu/)

Yes, the Cascados **is** focused on the [Open Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Definition) Software initiatives [in GIS](http://conference.osgeo.org/):

> The Cascados Project aims at building up a critical mass of Open Source 
> users within the [GMES](http://www.gmes.info/) society, which could 
> support each other in finding open source solutions for environmental related problems.

and as a natural consequence of this are of interest, the Cascados project partners [have put their eyes up](http://www.cascadoss.eu/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6&Itemid=7) to the OSGeo Foundation too. That's great.

There are planned two interesting [Cascados events](http://www.cascadoss.eu/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=8&Itemid=10) this year, both will take place in Warsaw, Poland:

  * [International Symposium](http://www.cascadoss.eu/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=23) - 16 June 2008
  * [International Information Workshop](http://www.cascadoss.eu/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=22&Itemid=22) - 17-19 June 2008

The [registration](http://www.cascadoss.eu/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=2) for both events has just started.
