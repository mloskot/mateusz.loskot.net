![Flag of Canada](/images/canada-flag.jpg)Today is a **wonderful day**! The Canadian minister of immigration and citizenship Diane Finley announced that citizens of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Lithuania can _travel to Canada and remain there for 3 months without a visa_.




I'm a Polish, so hurray! One of my dream has become truth.




[Visiting the Vancouver Island in September 2007](http://www.foss4g2007.org/) with my fiancee Aneta [stroke](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/1444352419/in/set-72157602151720627/) our [fancies](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/1445214378/in/set-72157602151720627/) and we are going to come to back there, probably after the journey to Cape Town for the [FOSS4G 2008](http://conference.osgeo.org/).




It is not a secret that our long term plan is to stay and work in Canada for a couple of years or longer.
