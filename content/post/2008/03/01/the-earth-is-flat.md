It may be surprising, but some people still believe it is. Here is an interesting debate the [Al-Fayhaa TV](http://www.alfayhaa.tv/) aired in 2007, during which [astronomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy) researcher is arguing with [physicist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist) on this subject:









It's been nearly 500 years since [Nicolaus Copernicus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus) and afterward [Galileo Galilei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei) proved with their researches that we do not leave on a plate but on a potato. Not to mention what we've learned from a number of space missions and explorations made with satellites. By the way of digression, how would the [Global Navigation Satellite Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Navigation_Satellite_System) work if the [Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) was [flat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth)? Hmm...
