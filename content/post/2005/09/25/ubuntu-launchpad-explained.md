About week ago I joined to  [Ubuntu Polish Translators](https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-l10n-pl). 
First, I had to learn how to use the [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/) services and I was stucked. 
I could not get a clue what are all those Launchpad tools for, how to use them. 
As a newbie contributor I needed some introduction presenting the idea behind the Launchpad.

After a few days [ZK](http://www.suxx.pl/blog) posted a very handy explanation 
[About Launchpad and moreâŚ](http://www.suxx.pl/blog/index.php/2005/09/20/about-launchpad-and-more/). 
I strongly recommend  every new user of the [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) and its Launchpad to read it first.
