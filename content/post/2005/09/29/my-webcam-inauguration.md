Today, I managed to put my webcam online. [Here](http://mateusz.loskot.net/webcam/) is the webcam page.
Thanks to Markus Gritsc for his great [VideoCapture](http://videocapture.sourceforge.net) - A Win32 Python Extension.
Now, when I'm booted to Windows, I can plug my webcam and run simple Python script uploading images to the web server.
Currently, it works only on Windows, but I'm going to do similar solution on Linux, because at home I mostly use Linux.

I'm having some problems with [spca5xx](http://mxhaard.free.fr) kernel module.
It freezes my computer with Ubuntu 5.10 when webcam client tries to access the _/dev/video0_.
I put my story on the [ubuntuforums.org](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=377397).
So, I believe someone will help me to fix it quickly. By now, only Windows-driven webcam is available.
