Yesterday, I collected books ordered on Amazon. Couple of weeks ago I wrote in my [First order on Amazon.com](http://mateusz.loskot.net/2005/10/28/first-order-on-amazoncom/) post that I was affraid about the estimated delivery time - middle of the December, 2005. I'm really surprised the delivery took only about 20 days. Good for Amazon! Now I'm sure these are not my last books I ordered on Amazon.

By the way, I want to thank [Tyler Mitchell](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/1898) for his recommendation to buy [Mapping Hacks](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mappinghks/). After first look it seems to be great resource for [mapping hackers](http://www.mappinghacks.com) and I'm sure I'll love it. **Thanks Tyler!**
