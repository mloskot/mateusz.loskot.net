**Update 2013-02-11:** [PyDecimalDegrees](https://github.com/mloskot/PyDecimalDegrees) moved to GitHub

Small things also make us happy. Because I like small software gadgets, I created [DecimalDegrees](http://mateusz.loskot.net/software/gis/) - [Python](http://www.python.org) module. Frequently, we - GIS and GPS users - have to convert coordinates between various formats. Here comes DecimalDegrees module which wraps all those _higher math_ calculations into four Python functions. I hope this will be yet another small gadget which make someone happy :-)
