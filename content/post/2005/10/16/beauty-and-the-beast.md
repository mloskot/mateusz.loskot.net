When I saw this photo (below) for the first time, I had a great laugh and it reminded me well known story titled **Beauty and the Beast**. I think it's clear which one is the Beauty and which one is the Beast :-). The very next moment, I had a pity on this poor boy [Thomas Ulrich](http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=007115) (on the left) that having such a pretty face, he must go and fight with _iron hammers_ of our [Tomek Adamek](http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=014883).

Don't you think Thomas Ulrich fits better to cover of some magazine for women (or men, that's matter of taste) than to the boxing ring? May be he has never took a look in the mirror, I don't know. I would say he is like owner of a brand new [Mercedes](http://www.mercedes-benz.com) who goes to race with [Monster Trucks](http://www.monstertrucks.net), completely unaware. Brrr!
So, from 3rd round Tomek Adamek started giving this german a solid thrashing. Finally, the Beast from Poland smashed up the Beauty's face ;-)
