title: Webcam issue solved!

---

Four weeks ago I reported on [Ubuntu Forums](http://www.ubuntuforums.org) that my Ubuntu box freezes whenever I try to use webcam with [spca5xx](http://mxhaard.free.fr) driver. Here is my post [Breezy hangs when using webcam](http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=70203). So, it seems it works now. Four days ago I got a message from Alvaro Arenas with explanation how to solve this issue. Simply, I used wrong gcc version to build spca5xx driver - gcc 4.0 instead of 3.4 :-). Here you will find complete article explaining all details [[HOWTO] Using spca5xx webcam driver](http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=453021).

My smiling face is the proof Alvaro's solution works :-)

Now, I'm going to find some nice software to play with my webcam. Do you have any suggestions?
