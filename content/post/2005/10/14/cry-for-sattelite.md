title: Cry for Sattelite!

---

BBC announced that [European satellite presumed lost](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4323250.stm). 
What does it mean? It means [European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int) lost their spacecraft somewehere 
in the [space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space). ESA hasn't confirmed yet it is definitely lost, 
but russian space gurus reported it is - crashed to the sea. 
It was called [CryoSat](http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Cryosat/index.html) and was sent into 
orbit to [monitor ice cover and climate](http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Cryosat/SEMQK4908BE_0.html).

So, 135 million Euro disappeared somewhere above our heads. Let's repeat: _one hundred thirty five million_ Euro is gone. 
I think ESA officials should now rename their spacecraft to CryForSat as a short of _Cry For Sattelite_. 
But as I read from BBC article, they are not crying at all. 
They lost 135 millions and they are not crying? How is this possible!

Chief scientist Duncan Wingham sums it up this way:


> _Space is a risky business, it always has been._
