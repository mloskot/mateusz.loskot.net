All right, I confess, I've lied a bit in the topic. I'm not going to discuss any of the [Free and Open Source Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software) philosophies here. What I'm going to do is to smuggle an interesting discussion that I believe it may be interesting to other Open Source Software [hackers](http://catb.org/hacker-emblem/), especially projects from the C/C++ camp of the [OSGeo Foundation](http://www.osgeo.org). I would also say that subject of this discussion is quite idiomatic to the universe of [FOSS production](http://producingoss.com/). It is about a software project. A project that has grown and it has grown in many dimensions, also in parallel dimensions.

Infrastructure supporting a project becomes insufficient, maintenance is difficult, _release process is a full-time job_ and _situation has taken a lot of the fun out of participating_. Population of users and developers has grown. As the [Community](http://lists.osgeo.org) gathers appreciable portfolio of [masters of the software development craft](http://www.boost.org/users/people.html), it is in constant state of snowball war exchanging fire of ideas, new projects and discussions. It's truly a pleasure to learn about them but, well, it pours oil on the fire of entropy. Here we come to the crux.

Today, [David Abrahams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Abrahams_%28computer_programmer%29) posted, somewhat provocative, e-mail to the [Boost](http://www.boost.org) project mailing list. It is titled [Boost, Decoupled and Accelerated](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.boost.devel/200952) and delivers the following message: _It's time to make Boost development fun again_.


It may sound like yet another internal discussion within an Open Source project. There are zillions of similar debates archived around. Yes, indeed, but not exactly. In fact, David announced something that may be of wider interested. It is

One may think, well, it seems related to the issue of [the current trends](http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/category/myths-of-innovation/) or we're suffering redundancy in [IT prophets](http://twitter.com/timoreilly/statuses/10186975174). [Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps...](http://www.lyricsdepot.com/DORIS-DAY/perhaps-perhaps-perhaps.html) but what I know for sure is that David Abrahams is one of my favourite and highly regarded software developer and author. I can hardly recall any of David's comments, observations or suggestions that would be lacking of point, I mean a very rational point.


I have licked a bit of experience myself of working with or maintaining complex projects or projects that feel complex. I think I wouldn't risk anything saying David has a point. I'm looking forward learning more about the whole idea.


I hope I'll be able to confirm it myself while listening to David's presentation at [BoostCon'10](http://www.boostcon.com/).
