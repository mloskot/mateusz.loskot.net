I have just given [ohloh.net](https://www.ohloh.net/) [kudos](https://www.ohloh.net/about/kudos) to [Richard Stallman](https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/rms) and [Linus Torvalds](https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/9897).


Hehe, and I didn't do it because I expect to be given back with a kudo from [RMS](http://stallman.org/) or [Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds). I did it because I appreciated the bloody good software development works they do: my favourite C/C++ compiler from [GCC](https://www.ohloh.net/p/gcc), one of my favourite text editors [GNU Emacs](https://www.ohloh.net/p/emacs) and my favourite operating system - [Unix for Masses](https://www.ohloh.net/p/linux) and my favourite version control system [Git](https://www.ohloh.net/p/git).
