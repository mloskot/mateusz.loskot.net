Activity of the [OSGeo](http://www.osgeo.org) Community quite [heavily relies](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2008-August/004111.html) on the [Freenode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode) [IRC](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/IRC) network, so this may be an interesting news:


> hackers are exploiting a weakness in the Mozilla Firefox browser to wreak
> havoc on Freenode and other networks that cater to users of internet relay chat.

[![hacker emblem](http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/glider.png)](http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/)Mr [Dan Goodin](http://twitter.com/dangoodin001), I would wish you don't cultivate the mainstream media alignment regarding the use of word [hacker](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html). Don't call a _hacker_ someone who has _unlawful intentions_, please.
