It's a must-not-miss event!


I started my Open Source Software advantures as a developer around 2002. I haven't been maintaining a project for longer than a couple of years, but I have decent experience in working with aged and well-settled projects. I have made observations. Here, one talk especially interests me. It should be intesteing to every long time maintainers of Open Source projects based on C++ programming language. It is [Renovating a legacy C++ project](http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2010/accu2010_sessions#Renovating%20a%20legacy%20C++%20project) by noble ACCU member [Alan Griffiths](http://www.octopull.demon.co.uk/).
