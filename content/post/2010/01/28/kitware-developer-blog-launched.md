[![CMake - cross-platform build system](/images/logos/cmake-logo.png)](http://www.cmake.org/)A few minutes ago, [Bill Hoffman](http://mateusz.loskot.net/?p=1660) from [Kitware](http://www.kitware.com/) posted short message to the [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) project mailing list with an interesting announce:


> Kitware [launched](http://www.kitware.com/news/home/browse/267) its first
> [developer blog](http://www.kitware.com/blog/) today with contributions from Company technical and business leaders.


The [CMake build system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake) is one of the main category of topics on the Kitware blog, so I presume it may be of interest of [OSGeo](http://www.osgeo.org) Community as the CMake build system is slowly winning over [more](http://mateusz.loskot.net/category/tools/cmake-tools/) and [more](http://www.qgis.org) folks here :-)


First CMake-related post is about [Deploying on Windows with DLL Manifest Issue](http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/4)


Another interesting post on the blog is [Will Schroeder](http://www.kitware.com/company/team/schroeder.html)'s answer to the question [Why Open Source Will Rule Scientific Computing?](http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/3) It's really worth reading.
