![OSGeo Foundation](/images/logos/osgeo-logo.png)[Maxim Dubinin](http://silvis.forest.wisc.edu/people/dubinin.asp) syndicated [GIS-Lab](http://gis-lab.info/) blog with the [Planet OSGeo](http://planet.osgeo.org) aggregator.


A few words [about GIS-Lab](http://gis-lab.info/about-eng.html) from their website:


> GIS-Lab - informal non-commercial community of GIS/RS specialists, we grow ourselves and help grow others.

GIS-Lab exists since April 2002 as an independent online resource specializing in geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS). At present, the site is primarily oriented towards Russian-speaking GIS community, however, we do our best to translate as many materials as possible into English.


The GIS-Lab is the very first blog in Russian language syndicated with the Planet OSGeo, what makes the planet yet more international geo-caffee.
