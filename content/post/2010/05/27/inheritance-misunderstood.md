In [C++](http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/smalltalk.html) inheritance is **not for code reuse**. Full stop. Think [subtyping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping). Think interface. Think substitution. Think specification. Learn about LSP - [Liskov Substitution Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle). Never ever think reuse.


I'm amazed, shamefully, how often I forget about it and I drift away thinking how to save on keyboard use and typing.
