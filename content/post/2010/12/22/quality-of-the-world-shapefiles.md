It is [Shapefile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) with borders of the World countries. The data is the same but different and sometimes the differences are very surprising.

Here is [part 1](http://barendgehrels.blogspot.com/2010/12/free-shapefile-of-countries-of-world.html) and [part 2](http://barendgehrels.blogspot.com/2010/12/free-shapefiles-of-of-world-2.html) of the excellent comparison made by Barend.
