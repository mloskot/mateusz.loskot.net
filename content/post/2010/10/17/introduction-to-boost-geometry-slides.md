[![Boost Geometry (aka Generic Geometry Library, GGL)](/images/logos/ggl-logo.png)](http://trac.osgeo.org/ggl/)Slides of my very gentle [introduction](/?p=2064) to [Boost Geometry](http://trac.osgeo.org/ggl/) library are now available to [download](http://2010.foss4g.org/presentations_show.php?id=3785) from the [FOSS4G 2010](http://2010.foss4g.org/) website.


The presentation gives a basic overview of the library and tries to explain how it is different to existing solutions but in such way so it's also understandable to non-C++ programmers. Those who are looking forward to digging out very details of Boost Geometry, I recommend to check [presentation](http://www.filetolink.com/77275ecc) which [Barend Gehrels](http://barendgehrels.blogspot.com/) gave at [BoostCon](http://www.boostcon.com/) 2010.
