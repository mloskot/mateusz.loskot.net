The hilarious trailer of JAVATAR makes a brilliant psychological observation of human beings approaching different or new technologies. The _technological emotions syndrome_ as pictured here is funny and scary at the same time. Had there been no emotions expressed about IT, we wouldn't observe all the holy battles _trolled out_ loudly out there.

Linux vs Windows. FOSS vs Proprietary. C++ vs Java. OSGeo vs ESRI. Python vs PHP. <your favourite technology> vs <your hated technology>


The funny part is the situation comedy being pictured. The worrying thing is, had the comedy not been pictured, we wouldn't see it's a comedy. A kind of drama, actually.
