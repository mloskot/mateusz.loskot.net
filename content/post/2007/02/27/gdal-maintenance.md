[![GDAL logo](/images/logos/gdal-logo.png)](http://www.gdal.org/)[Frank Warmerdam](http://home.gdal.org/~warmerda/) announced on the [OSGeo](http://www.osgeo.org) website, in the [GDAL Project Maintainer Contracted](http://www.osgeo.org/node/278) news, that I've started _general GDAL maintenance and support activities_. In fact, it will be a continuation, because I have been involved in [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) project since March 2006, or a bit longer.







I'm very happy and thankful about this opportunity. I hope my services will be valuable to the GDAL project and bring a nice set of improvements.







If anyone of you, GDAL or [OGR](http://www.gdal.org/ogr/) users, will have any comments or suggestions related to GDAL issues, or you will need any help in this subject, please [drop me a note](http://mateusz.loskot.net/contact/) or step in to the [#gdal](irc://irc.freenode.net/#gdal) channel on the [irc.freeenode.net](http://freenode.net/) server to talk about it.
