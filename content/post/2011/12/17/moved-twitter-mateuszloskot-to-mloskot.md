Long time ago, I'd used [twitter.com/mloskot](http://twitter.com/mloskot) account which I [removed](/?p=1100). Someone had taken it over and when I decided to come back to Twitter, I had to register as [twitter.com/mateuszloskot](http://twitter.com/mateuszloskot).


Today, Pantera noticed `mloskot` account has been released - someone apparently has got fed up with twitting :) - so I have switched back to my old account name.


It seems Twitter is pretty clever and preserves all my following/followers and status settings. Sweet.
