Yesterday near the end of climbing session at the 
[Castle Climbing](http://www.castle-climbing.co.uk/), I had a quick chat with 
[Gaz Parry](http://www.gazparryclimbing.com) about some crazy bodyweight exercises.

Gaz was talking about this curious challenge of push-ups performed along
Moby's song called [Flower](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sWb1iR2mzM) where 
push-up reps are controlled by the phrase *Bring Sally Up, Bring Sally Down...*

I was getting hooked, then Gaz mentioned a video on YouTube with someone performing
variation of this challenge, not on floor but 
[on three medicine balls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAEz6vg3a8E).
The strong man turns out to be Lee Tiffin from the 
[Black Sheep Fitness Academy](http://www.blacksheepfitnessacademy.com).
[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-Wnl4X1cNo) is clip with Lee 
performing the regular version of the challenge.

> "I can do that, Hold my beer!"

Obviously, I had to tried it myself. After work, I did my first attempt to 
challenge the verses of *Bring Sally Up, Bring Sally Down* with miserable results :)

I only endured half of the length of the song :$

I've stood corrected about my place and #humble me is back to training \*\\0\/\*

Next attempt, next week!
