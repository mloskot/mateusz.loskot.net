[Continuing](/?p=1562) my _watch stand-up comedy every night_ week...




Today, it's [Jimmy Carr's](http://www.jimmycarr.com/) turn:





> Britain boasts the most hardworking and adaptable workforce in Europe...It's called the Poles. They're bloody good. There's a lot of right wing people that say these poles come over here and take our jobs. If a guy from [Poland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland) arrives, he doesn't speak the language, doesn't have any money, doesn't know anyone and he takes your job on the first day?





Now I understand why uncle [Sam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Sam) doesn't want to let Polish in still [asking us for visa](http://www.thenews.pl/international/artykul116448_kaczynski_not_hiding_disappointment_in_new_york.html). I'm telling ya unc' ain't do it ;-)
