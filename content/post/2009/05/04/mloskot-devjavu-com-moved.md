[Jeff Lindsay](http://progrium.com/) announced [DevjaVu will be shutting down](http://blog.devjavu.com/2009/05/01/devjavu-will-be-shutting-down/). This is bad news of the day for me, because I've been hosting on [DevjaVu](http://www.devjavu.com/) my personal workshop repository with miscellaneous prototypes and experiments at [http://mloskot.devjavu.com/](http://mloskot.devjavu.com/).





Due to Jeff's decision, I've moved my repo to [GitHub](http://github.com/mloskot/) where is available as all-in-one _workshop_ repository at [http://github.com/mloskot/workshop/](http://github.com/mloskot/workshop/):




    
    git clone git://github.com/mloskot/workshop.git





I?d like to send **big thanks** to Jeff and the [DevjaVu](http://blog.devjavu.com/about/) team for two years of providing top-notch [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) and [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) services. Good luck!
