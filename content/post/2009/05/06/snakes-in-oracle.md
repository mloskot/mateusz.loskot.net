Latest [Oracle's Dev2DBA](http://www.oracle.com/newsletters/samples/dev2dba.html) newsletter issued in May 2009 brings a nice collection of articles revealing _some tips for getting the most out of Python_ and Oracle.




Most of the articles are accessible through [Python tagged bookmarks](http://delicious.com/OracleTechnologyNetwork/python) of [Oracle Technology Network](http://delicious.com/OracleTechnologyNetwork/).




Looks like must read resource for all Pythonistas living in the Oracle.
