In one of presentations from this year's edition of [BoostCon](http://www.boostcon.com/), I found a small track of [Quantum GIS](http://qgis.org/) project. This is [Bill Hoffman](http://www.kitware.com/company/team/hoffman.html)'s presentation titled [A CMake-Based Software Process for Development and Integration Testing](http://www.boostcon.com/program/sessions#hoffman-king-a-cmake-based-software-process-for-development-and) ([PDF](http://www.boostcon.com/site-media/var/sphene/sphwiki/attachment/2009/05/01/cmake-kitware.pdf)) and the track is citation taken from Martin Dobias' blog post [Having fun with CMake](http://blog.qgis.org/?q=node/16):



> I was quite surprised with the speed of building Quantum GIS codebase in comparison to Autotools.





All presentations from the BoostCon'09 are available to [download](http://www.boostcon.com/community/wiki/show/private/2009/) including [Barend](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2009-February/005002.html)'s [slides](http://www.boostcon.com/site-media/var/sphene/sphwiki/attachment/2009/05/01/ggl.pdf) and [article](http://www.boostcon.com/site-media/var/sphene/sphwiki/attachment/2009/05/05/GGL_Paper.pdf) with about [Generic Geometry Library](http://www.boostcon.com/program/sessions#gehrels-lalande-a-generic-geometry-library). There are much more interesting materials from the conference available and as another one somehow related to geospatial works, I'd like to point [Graphics Programming Workshop](http://www.boostcon.com/program/sessions#brinkman-graphics-programming-workshop-chart-library) about programming with [Adobe's Graphics Interface Library](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/gil/Generic+Image+Library) which is a part of [Boost C++ Libraries](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/?view=category_Image-processing) (>= 1.35.0). There are both, slides and source codes, available to [download](http://www.reportbase.com/boostcon09.html).
