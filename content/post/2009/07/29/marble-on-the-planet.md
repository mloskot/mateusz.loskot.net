I'd like to welcome new member of the [Planet OSGeo](http://planet.osgeo.org/) - [Torsten Rahn's blog](http://www.kdedevelopers.org/blog/551) about [Marble](http://edu.kde.org/marble/) - educational project from KDE. I believe the Marble project somehow complements the mission of the Planet and as Torsten wrote in his e-mail requesting syndication:





> It deals almost exclusively with our Free Software project Marble and promotion of FLOSS GIS and open map content.

So, welcome!
