![Don't ask what OSGeo can do for you, ask what you can do for OSGeo](/images/iwantyou.jpg)Today, I sent [a post to OSGeo Discuss mailing list](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2009-August/005717.html) asking for help with finding new home for my Mac Pro workstation. I'm trying to use all possible [channels](http://logs.qgis.org/osgeo/%23osgeo.2009-08-21.log) to [spread my call](http://twitter.com/mloskot/status/3451511689), so here we go:

> Folks,
>
> [I have a pretty powerful workstation](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/3842425399/) that I'd like to connect to OSGeo infrastructure, somehow. It is: [Mac Pro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Pro):
>
>  * 2 x [Intel Xeon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Xeon) 2.66GHz (5150, "Woodcrest", dual core)
>  * 16 GB RAM
>  * 1.5 TB HDD
>
> If I'll manage to find a new home for my machine, I want to extend the RAM to 16 GB and get one or more TB of HDD.
>
> I'm looking for possibility of collocation my machine somewhere in UK (not necessarily in London),
> so it can be permanently connected to OSGeo infrastructure.
> Unfortunately, I am not able to connect this machine from home and keep connected 24/7.
>
> I would be delighted to make it available for OSGeo projects and their development purposes
> like [Buildbot](http://buildbot.osgeo.org), scheduled builds, software testing, etc.
> The only personal use of this machine I would like to be able to do is...development and
> software testing of OSGeo software I work with plus I'd like to keep some personal backups
> there (disks are getting cheap, so it shouldn't be a problem to extent to tens of TB in near future).
> OS X Leopard and license for [Parallels VM](http://www.parallels.com/) software is included.
>
> I tried to find collocation service in Poland or UK but prices like ~100 GBP/month are too
> high to pay for the purposes I'd like to dedicate my machine to.
>
> So, if anyone knows a data centre in UK that would be interested in "rescuing" the wasted
> CPU cycles of my machine resting in the box please let me know. I think providing collocation
> could be a nice way to sponsor OSGeo by contributing this reasonably good hardware option :-)
>
> Currently, the machine rests in box in my flat in Poland (I live in London, UK).
> If I find a place for it, I'll ship it from PL to UK quickly.
