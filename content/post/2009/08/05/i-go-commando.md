[![Arnold Schwarzeneger as Commando](/images/commando.jpg)](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000825.html)No, I haven't got a [call-up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription) to army. Actually, I run away from my country just in time in December 2008 :-) . However, a few months later [Minister of National Defence of Poland](http://www.wp.mil.pl/en/index/) [announced](http://www.wp.mil.pl/en/artykul/7375) [good news](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/2505447/Poland-ends-army-conscription.html) and I hope to not to be executed by firing squad for [desertion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertion) when I visit my family in Poland some time in future ;-)





[Going Commando](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000825.html) is about stopping using the mouse as _one of the quickest ways to increase your productivity on the computer_. I always knew that! I always believed using mouse is a waste of time and it's worthwhile effort to [let the mouses out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Let_the_Dogs_Out%3F) and stick the fingers to keyboard as [the first step to coding faster](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2006/10/24/The-first-step-to-coding-faster.aspx).





By the way, I've just reminded myself that this is not the first time I _do commando_. A few or more years ago, while reading [Ed Yourdon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Yourdon)'s book [Death March](http://www.yourdon.com/?loc=publications), I realised: _I am a commando coder: I'm drinking jars of coffee and I'm staying 1.5 to 2 shifts at work. Now, I understand that the military approach was necessary and very natural because [a start-up without commandos has nothing to sell](http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/839/748) and __if there are no commandos left in a company, there is no innovation_ ;-) However, I'm glad I'm no longer drinking jars of coffee as _[this approach is less efficient; it results in poorer code that actually takes longer to produce](http://dave.thielen.com/articles/mea%20culpa.doc)_.





Hmm, I've just discovered I have pretty strong military background :-)
