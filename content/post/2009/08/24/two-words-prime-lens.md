Today, during a short trip to [Watford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watford), I was testing my new gadget brought to me by [weihnachtsmann](http://www.finland.de/santaclaus/) called eBay (but he asked for ten pints of [proper lager](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCCzS6vEbaE), what a tank!). It is prime lens [SMC PENTAX-A 1:2 50 mm](http://www.bdimitrov.de/kmp/lenses/primes/normal/A50f2.html). It's an old lens but it's a superb piece of optical craft dated between 1985 and 1998. No modern rubbish plastic. Pure metal classic!

After first five shots taken in darknesses of the night and the [Underground](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/), my conclusion is quite simple, the kit lens [Pentax SMC-DA 18-55mm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentax_K10D) that comes with Pentax K10D body belongs to a trash bin. Pentax prime lens rock and [it's not British](http://www.natgeochannel.co.uk/programmes/britains-greatest-machines), it's Japanese :-)
