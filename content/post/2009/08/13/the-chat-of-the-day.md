From today's [ACCU](http://accu.org/) diary:

Mike: _Would having [chartered engineers](http://lists.accu.org/mailman/private/accu-general/2009-August/016040.html) "in charge" really make any difference to the numerous public sector IT projects which are struggling to meet their objectives?_

Me: _May be, at least, they would manage to convince the [EU](http://europa.eu/) bureaucracy that the [waterfall model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) should go :-)_

Chris: _Why... The waterfall has been proven in use on many successful projects...   Ask [NASA](http://cost.jsc.nasa.gov/pcehhtml/pceh.htm)._

Mike: _Now I've got the image of [NASA doing agile development](http://elephantangelchild.blogspot.com/2009/04/dancing-under-waterfall.html) stuck in my brain:_

> Developer: "Good news, Mr Armstrong. We've got the software for launching your rocket done. Let us know when you get to the Moon, and we'll start working on the landing procedures..."

;-)
