I've added [Generic Geometry Library](http://geometrylibrary.geodan.nl/) (GGL) to the software stack on Ohloh.net [here](https://www.ohloh.net/p/generic-geometry-library). The code analysis is being generated from [Preview releases](http://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2009/02/148450.php) frequently uploaded to [Sandbox](https://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/ggl) in SVN [repository](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost) of [Boost C++ Libraries](http://boost.org/). This repository is not the development mainstream, but it is being updated every time new preview is issued..
