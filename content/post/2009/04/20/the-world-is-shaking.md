[Oracle Buys Sun](http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/04/20/128246&art_pos=3). Tom [asked](http://www.kralidis.ca/blog/2009/04/20/sun-oracle-and-mysql/) _What this will mean for [MySQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL)?_. I can make a wager this is going to happen:






  * MySQL will be laid to rest (R.I.P.)


  * Oracle will continue (harder?) promoting [Oracle Express](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/xe/index.html) as the leading free-of-charge database solution for Web shops and similar.


  * [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) stays where it is on position of the best Open Source Database Management System in the World.





Anybody is going to predict what will happen to [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))?
