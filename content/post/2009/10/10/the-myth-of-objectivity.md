I do not advocate _anything_ or _anyone_. All right, may be I do advocate but only a few small tiny things like [C++ programming language](http://cpp-next.com/), [generic programming](http://www.boost.org/) and [high quality of software code and design](http://www.research.att.com/~bs/JSF-AV-rules.pdf) and [my dog](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/tags/dog), of course. However, I let myself to go down in the discussion about [advantages and disadvantages of Open Source GIS](http://www.linkedin.com/groupAnswers?viewQuestionAndAnswers=&gid=55322&discussionID=7776133&goback=.anh_55322) on [OGC forum](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&gid=55322&trk=anet_ug_hm&goback=.anh_55322) at LinkedIn and somewhat at [OSGeo mailing list](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2009-October/006085.html) too.





A human nature pisses me off, sometimes. (I am a human being, in case of doubt.) The world is bloody relative but we love to sling absolutes around. Yeah, [we love this game!](http://www.nba.com/video/i_love_this_game.html) We are not good in learning from mistakes, anyway. Thus, the only achievement of attempting to [apply a patch](http://directory.fsf.org/project/patch/) to someone's buggy ignorance is _a waste of time_ and may be a bit of training in fast typing or boxing ;-)





[Paul](http://www.cleverelephant.ca/) is right [recommending](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2009-October/006089.html) _don't feed the troll!_. But, what has been learned is going to be lost, naturally.
