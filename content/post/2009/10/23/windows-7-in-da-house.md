Windows 7 [Professional](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/compare/professional.aspx). Windows 7 Professional [64-bit](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/features/64-bit-support.aspx)!


### [Computer says no!](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=computer+says+no+little+britain)


I like the new Windows 7 as much as a [Unix-devoted user](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/1558750896/) can like Windows way of use of OS. However, _no joy without annoy_ and along with delivering modern operating system [Microsoft definitely and absolutely has earned ](http://www.microsoft.com/)[Darwin Award](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Awards) by providing users with [easy and friendly purchase & setup process](http://www.sevenforums.com/installation-setup/30622-doing-clean-install-upgrade-windows-7-version-7.html#post323460).





[To make the long story short](http://www.sevenforums.com/installation-setup/30945-help-creating-install-media-student-download.html#post324668), basically you complete clean installation of Windows 7 without giving the Product Key (don't even waste time on trying, Microsoft will reject it as invalid), next you carry out upgrading the newly installed Windows 7 to...Windows 7 and then you are able to successfully register and activate your legal copy of the system.


Ah, and don't forget to feel the lovely pain in the arse while preparing bootable ISO. That fun is so  worth those thirty quid I paid for the Windows 7, hehe.


### Microsoft says yes!


On the [Microsoft Answers](http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7install/thread/cb679e27-f2e6-4cd5-b708-a4992cec5a9d):

Oh, gosh, I need to be quick with e-mailing [Wendy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Northcutt) with my proposal of Microsoft nomination.


After quite long and silly battle, [I finally installed Windows 7 Professional 64-bit on my computer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/tags/windows7/). Actually, on Virtual Machine running under control of [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org) (Sun, I love you!) inside Linux.


Dear Microsoft, I'm impressed. I like Windows 7.

*** Poland is a rich country. Polish are rich people. Microsoft knows that and asks ~25-30% more for their software. Not like in developing countries, UK or US, where they try to make their software affordable to help people to in studying or running small businesses. So, if you live in Poland and you don't want to overpay for Microsoft software, buy it in US. Ask your aunt (every Polish has auntie in US) to buy a box for you and ship it to Poland. It is legal. I called Microsoft Poland and confirmed it is legal to buy their software in US, bring it to Poland and use it in Poland. Sweet.
