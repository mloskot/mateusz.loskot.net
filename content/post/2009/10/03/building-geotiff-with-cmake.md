I've just submitted ticket to [GeoTIFF](http://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/) Trac system with patch providing [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) build configuration for GeoTIFF library and utility programs.





[#17](http://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/ticket/17) - _CMake build configuration for GeoTIFF_





It also includes [FindGeoTIFF](http://github.com/mloskot/workshop/tree/master/cmake/modules/) module for CMake users that need to determine availability of libgeotiff in their projects. Tests and improvements are welcome.
