A tiny discussion about climate change triggered by [FOSS4G 2009](http://2009.foss4g.org/) talks logged by seven on [#osgeo IRC channel](http://logs.qgis.org/osgeo/%23osgeo.2009-10-21.log): 



    
    [seven] The Earth's climate is changing.
    [seven] Finally it seems like it is not a discussion any more.
    [seven] We messed the world up and now?
    [seven] We go fly to down under. Huh.
    [mloskot] The Earth climate is a self-modifying code performing multi processing tasks, quite hard to debug
    [seven] Debug earth's climate is easy: Remove humanity
    [seven] says a dedicated Borg...
    [mloskot] seven:  right, that sounds like a reasonable patch
