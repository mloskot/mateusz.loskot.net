I had to apply [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) licensing to a source code I was writing. I hit on [gnu.org](http://www.gnu.org) and started reading the [HOWTO](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html)...bla bla bla...





> either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version





IANAL, concerns and confusions started to spin my head around. Let's ask the only and the bloody search engine used by 99.999% of the world human population. As usually [Linus](http://www.linux.org/info/linus.html) Torvalds [succours](http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/15/262):





> The fact is, anybody who cares about the copyright license he uses on software (and I sure do care!) should *never* give a blank check to somebody else that they don't trust to change that license for them.





Sound very reasonable.





> - ..or you trust the FSF implicitly.
In this case, you're not an independent entity, you're just a lackey
of the FSF when it comes to the license.






Sounds disturbing!




The FSF "generously and helpfully" suggests the most idiotic and the least advantageous option assuming that _[everybody trusts FSF](http://www.everybodylovesray.com/)_. It's just not right!





Hmm, paraphrasing [Linus Torvalds' famous statement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8): _if your GPL-ed code includes **or any later version** in license notice, you shouldn't be here. You should be in some mental institution, somewhere else._
