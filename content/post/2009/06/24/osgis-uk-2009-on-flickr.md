I've just finished uploading photos taken on the [OSGIS UK 2009](http://www.opensourcegis.org.uk/) in Nottingham, so [here is the set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/sets/72157620410984670/).





I've re-re-re-learned the lesson [that light conditions](http://www.dcmag.co.uk/How_to_shoot_well_in_low_light_conditions.YffwKORo39cnPg.html) in a conference venue is bad and I should always bring a proper [strobe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_(photography)). Otherwise, pictures are dark or very grained (high ISO) or blured (mostly, unless your name is [Arnold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger) The Steel Grip). Ah, one more thing, don't buy a DSLR with lens included, it simply is a waste of money. [The kit lens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentax_K10D) is a piece of @#$%^&!, so just buy a body and then buy a proper (read: expansive) lens from [Pentax](http://www.flickr.com/cameras/pentax/k10d/) (or Sigma). [To quote the classics](http://www.vimeo.com/1841244):





_you are awesome_

_you have awesome camera_

_but it's useless_

_without (proper) lens_






Anyway, it's always nice to have some photolog after events, even if the pictures are of bad quality.
