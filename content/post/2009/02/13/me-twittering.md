Looks like I've also picked up a bug. The _Twittereus Notorious_ has caught me up - [http://twitter.com/mloskot](http://twitter.com/mloskot)




I could blame [Martin](http://blog.lostinspatial.com/), I think, as he's shown me with the nice [#uksnow](http://www.benmarsh.co.uk/snow/) thing but I won't ;-) Martin immediately cooled me down saying it's gonna be short-time infection...most likely. If not, I will probably need to ask for cure refund ;-)
