Hamish has [announced](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-user/2009-February/048716.html) a short [tutorial](http://grass.osgeo.org/wiki/LIDAR#Micro-tutorial) about how to [libLAS](http://liblas.org/) and [GRASS](http://grass.osgeo.org/) together to process LiDAR data encoded in ASPRS LAS format:





> It is actually quite a simple task, but sometimes the incantations and programs to use are not so obvious if you haven't used the software extensively.






Indeed, I'm sure many of us will find Hamish's writing helpful. I still have a hope to find time to instrument [GRASS with libLAS support](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2008-May/037682.html) implemented as a module. Another option is to find someone who would be interested in doing it - I'm good in delegating, aren't I? If there would be anyone, please don't hesitate to drop a message on [liblas-devel](http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/liblas-devel).
