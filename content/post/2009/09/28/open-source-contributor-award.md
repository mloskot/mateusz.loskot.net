![GDAL logo](/images/logos/gdal-logo.png) Today, [Even Rouault added](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/3158) a very cool feature to [ogr2ogr](http://gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html) utility from [GDAL/OGR](http://gdal.org/) package. It is `-wrapdateline` switch that _split geometries crossing the dateline meridian_ which is longitude of +/- 180 degrees. It will be available in upcoming [GDAL 1.7.0](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/milestone/1.7.0) release.





Hopefully, I won't touch anybody and I'd like to take the [freedom of speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS) I have (thank you UK) to say something: Since the very first day Even [joined](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2007-August/013783.html) GDAL project, I've been truly amazed how [extremely active and productive](https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/rouault) an Open Source developer can be. Even is fixing bugs and bringing new features almost in **real-time**. If there was _Open Source Contributor Award_ ([OSGeo](http://osgeo.org), can you hear me?), I would cast my vote to Even with pleasure, absolutely.





Even's work is a kind of proof of a concept I've been observing for a few years: _you wanna see results, stay focused, brother!_ It looks to me Even is highly focused on GDAL project. I sometimes regret I've never managed to stay also focused on one, two or at most three projects.





`<excuse>`...but [Yeah but... no but...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zExc6SK4kpA) there are so many interesting software ideas and initiatives around... I've been more like a kid with [ADHD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder) who have been given permission to stay in a toy store overnight ;-)`</excuse>`
