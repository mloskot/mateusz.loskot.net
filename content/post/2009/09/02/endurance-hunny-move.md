Yesterday night, I went to [the temple of power](http://www.castle-climbing.co.uk/) where [Pantera](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/tags/pantera), my personal trainer recently, arranged 3 hours climbing session focused on endurance :-) So, I had to climb 18 routes with [grades](http://www.rockfax.com/publications/grades.html) (Sport, French), mostly, above 6. Here is the list: 6a, 6b+, 6c, 5+, 5+, 7a (first time attempt, 50%, bloody features), 6c, 6c, 6a, 6c, 6b, 6b, 6a, 6b+, 6a, 6a, 5, 5.
