[Slashgeo forwarded](http://technology.slashgeo.org/technology/09/09/10/1125210.shtml) an interesting news about [OpenLR](http://www.tomtom.com/page/openLR) initiative by [TomTom](http://www.tomtom.com/). A part of it is an open industry standard. Another part of it is an open source code library which is coming soon.





In the meantime, as it seems the complete stack of [PDFs](http://www.tomtom.com/page/openLR) has been published, would anyone be after [libopenlr.org](http://libopenlr.org) project, before TomTom will put its [red hands](http://www.gpsgazette.com/tomtom-refreshes-logo/tomtom/) on it? And the domain is [still available](http://www.whois.net/available-domains/libopenlr.org), by the way :-)
