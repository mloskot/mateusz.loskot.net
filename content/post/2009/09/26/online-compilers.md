Sometimes I need to compile and run a tiny snippet of C++ code. For example, I want to proof some concept or I want to give code example while chatting with friends. Sometimes I don't have access to good compiler. If I'm logged to [irc.freenode.net](http://freenode.net/), it's not a problem - [geordi](http://www.xs4all.nl/~weegen/eelis/geordi/) is there. I've just found a Web-based alternative - [codepad.org](http://codepad.org). [It is a pastebin](http://codepad.org/about) service that can compile, validate and execute your code.
