A bit of rumour. Today, I [spotted](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/timeline) a bunch of commits in [GDAL](http://gdal.org/) [repository](http://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/) made by Andrey that may suggest support for [OziExplorer](http://www.oziexplorer.com/) .MAP is being under development. For instance [17684](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/17684) and [17685](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/17685).
