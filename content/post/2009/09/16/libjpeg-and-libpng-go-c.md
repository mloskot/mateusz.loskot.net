I've just come across an interesting project(s). It is [jpegxx and pngxx]( http://www.mr-edd.co.uk/?p=117): two (or three if [imagexx](http://bitbucket.org/edd/imagexx/) adaptors counted) thin libraries wrapping [libjpeg](http://www.ijg.org/) and [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/) with interface of C++ streams, iterators and ranges.





It slowly is getting crowded around raster libraries in C++. Another alternative is [GIL](http://opensource.adobe.com/) developed by Adobe and included in [Boost C++ Libraries](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_40_0/libs/gil/doc/index.html) with collection of [IO and more extensions](http://gil-contributions.googlecode.com/).





[Just what tigers like best](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh). Isn't it?
