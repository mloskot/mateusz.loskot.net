[![Linux Today sponsored by Microsoft?](http://mateusz.loskot.net/gallery/_gallery_albums_store/fun/linuxtoday_sponsored_by_microsoft.thumb.jpg)](http://mateusz.loskot.net/gallery/fun/linuxtoday_sponsored_by_microsoft)A few minutes ago I opened [http://www.linuxtoday.com](http://www.linuxtoday.com) in my Firefox and I saw big box with many advertisements. Nothing special, right? But not this time. I took closer look and what I saw confused me much. The big title **Linux Reference Center** with smaller text below: **Sponsored by Microsoft**!!! Inside the box were many offensive news against Linux. Hmm, I wonder if guys from [Linux Today](http://www.linuxtoday.com) know what is going on there. _Halo, are you there...?_
