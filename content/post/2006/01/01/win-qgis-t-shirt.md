[QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) Community [has announced](http://www.qgis.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=111&Itemid=65&mosmsg=Thanks+for+your+vote%21) the contests for new name of the next QGIS release.








Hurry up and [Name the Next QGIS Version](http://qgis.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=81)!








Previous versions were named after developer's pets now. If you are courious about what pets own QGIS developers take a look [at this table](http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/DeveloperProfiles). It was funny indeed but QGIS Team decided to change it now to get more interesting and unique names for next versions. So, we need you help!








[There](http://qgis.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=81) are 29 names so far. I vote for my own proposal **Spatially Adjusted** which I've stolen from [James Fee's blog](http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com). **James I hope you are not angry with me**, it's just for fun ;-)
