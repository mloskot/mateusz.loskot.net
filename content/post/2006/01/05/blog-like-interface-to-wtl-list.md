![WTL Logo](/images/logos/wtl-logo.jpg)Today, I encoutered a very new for me Web gadget - [blog-like interaface](http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.windows.wtl) to [wtl@yahoogroups.com](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wtl) - [Windows Template Library](http://wtl.sourceforge.net) support list. It's really cool! It also provides [RSS feed](http://rss.gmane.org/gmane.comp.windows.wtl) to WTL list, so now I can add it as a channel to my [Thunderbird](http://www.thunderbird.pl) aggregator.





At once, I found WTL list is also available through [GMANE](http://gmane.org) gate, by HTTP or NNTP. Shame on me! It's there since [June 5, 2003](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.announce/1745). Better Later than Never :-)





Here it is [http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.windows.wtl](http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.windows.wtl)






WTL is a windowing extension for [ATL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vccore/html/_atl_ATL_Article_Overview.asp). For those who don't know WTL yet, here I put a few links which may be helpful to learn what is it:




  * Homepage: [http://wtl.sourceforge.net](http://wtl.sourceforge.net)


  * Articles: [http://www.codeproject.com/wtl/](http://www.codeproject.com/wtl/)
