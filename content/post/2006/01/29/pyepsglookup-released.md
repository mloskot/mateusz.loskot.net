Today, I released my new Python module:



> PyEPSGLookup is a small Python utility complementary to [Projection](http://hobu.biz/software/pyprojection) module derived from [Thuban](http://thuban.intevation.org) project. It provides user with functionality to query epsg file for projection parameters by its number or name.


If you have any comments [please tell me](/contact/).






PyEPSGLookup package and usage examples are available [here](/software/gis/pyepsglookup).
