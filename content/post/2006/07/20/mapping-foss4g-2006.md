[![FOSS4G Flyer](/images/logos/foss4g2006-flyer.png)](http://www.foss4g2006.org/site/pdf/FOSS4G2006_Flyer.pdf)As you can read on the FOSS4G 2006 website [http://foss4g2006.org](http://foss4g2006.org):


> FOSS4G2006 is a four day conference, bringing together all the Free and Open Source Software for Geoinformatics (FOSS4G) communities.



It will be hosted in Lausanne, Switzerland. I'm sure it will be one of the greatest GIS and Open Source event in the Europe this year.







I'm going to be there, so I took a few minutes to do a virtual reconnaissance. Moving my _finger on a map_, I found [venue of the FOSS4G 2006](http://www.foss4g2006.org/internalPage.py?pageId=10&confId=1). Here I put links to direct location of the FOSS4G 2006 in two web mapping services:




  * [in Google Maps](http://local.google.com/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF8&om=1&ll=46.5223,6.5763&spn=0.035435,0.07184)


  * [in Ask.com Maps](http://maps.ask.com/maps?l=lt%3D46.519303864%7Clg%3D6.5766048431%7Cal%3D-1%7Ccx%3D76623%7Ccy%3D-613730%7Czm%3D5%7Cvt%3D0~lt%3D46.51957%7Clg%3D6.56567%7Cad%3DLocal%20Road%20(25%20mph)%2C%20Ecublens%3AFre%2C%20Vaud%3AFre%201024%20CHE%7Csd%3D1%7Cdm%3D0~lt%3D46.51933%7Clg%3D6.57659%7Cad%3D1%3AFRE%2C%20Saint-Sulpice%3AFre%2C%20Vaud%3AFre%201025%20CHE%7Csd%3D0%7Cdm%3D0~#1)



[Ask.com street maps](http://maps.ask.com) are my favourite because those maps are highly detailed for countries and cities in Europe.

If you have [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com) installed, you can download following archives with [KML](http://earth.google.com/kml/) files:




  * [foss4g2006.kmz](/download/data/ge/foss4g2006.kmz) - general location


  * [epfl.kmz](/download/data/ge/epfl.kmz) - the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology


  * [unil.kmz](/download/data/ge/unil.kmz) - campus of the University of Lausanne








Have a nice virtual trip to the FOSS4G 2006 before you start real journey.
