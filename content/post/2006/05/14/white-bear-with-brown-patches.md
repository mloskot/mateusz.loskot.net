[![Polar and Grizzly Hybrid bear](http://mateusz.loskot.net/gallery/_gallery_albums_store/wild/bbc_hybrid_bear_laun.thumb.jpg)](http://mateusz.loskot.net/gallery/wild/bbc_hybrid_bear_laun)[BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk) [announced today](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4766217.stm) about rare discovery - a hybrid of grizzly and polar bear. Such hybrids were known from zoos or stories about coloured bears. I'm pretty surprised such hybrids have not been found till now.






Unfortunately, the bear was **shot dead** by _an American big game hunter_. Biologists said it was _the offspring of a male grizzly bear and a female polar bear_.
