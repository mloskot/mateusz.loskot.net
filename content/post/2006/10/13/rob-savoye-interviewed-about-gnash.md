A few weeks ago, Fabienne caught [Rob Savoye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Savoye) at the second O'Reilly EuroOSCON conference in Brussels, Belgium. She talked with Rob about [Gnash](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/) project - a free and open source media player and related streaming tools as well as about [personal content publishing](http://www.lulu.com/about/).






Rob also points very interesting issues and explains why closed products like [Adobe Flash Player](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) (formerly Macromedia) are supposed to violent your privacy when used to publish private content.

Currently, Rob is recruiting C++ programmers and contributors for Gnash project, so if you **dream in C++** I believe it's worth to get involved.
