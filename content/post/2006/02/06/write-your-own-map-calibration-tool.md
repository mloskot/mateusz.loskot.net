Yesterday, the [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com) announced new articles. One of them is a small tutorial about how to write simple [map calibration](http://www.gpsy.com/tutorials/calibration.html) tool in [.NET](http://www.codeproject.com/dotnet/) - [Geo-referencing {Map Calibration}](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/Calibrator.asp) by Mohammad Riazi and H.Riazi.






Besides map calibration technique, this article explains rudiments of coordinates transformation between Geographic coordinates (latitude and longtitude) to Cartesian coordiantes (X, Y) on plane. Along clear explanation a set of simple equations is also provided. In my opinion this article is a good start for beginners of GIS and GPS applications.
