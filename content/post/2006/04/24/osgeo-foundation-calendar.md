If you're interested in upcoming meetings and events from [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](https://www.osgeo.org), you can now bookmark [Foundation Calendar](http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/Foundation_Calendar) page on the [OSGeo Wiki](http://http://wiki.osgeo.org)





Yesterday, Jody Garnett did make those events available through [iCalendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) file from Google, so you can subscribe it using your favourite iCalendar reader, e.g. [Mozilla Sunbird](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/index.html).
