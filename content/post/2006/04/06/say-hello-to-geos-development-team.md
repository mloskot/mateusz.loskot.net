![GEOS Logo](/images/logos/postgis-globe-logo.gif)_...I'm going to talk big about myself a little..._
Yesterday, Paul Ramsey from [Refractions Research](http://www.refractions.net) gave me developer privileges to the official [GEOS](http://geos.refractions.net) CVS repository. So, now I think I can say Hello! to the GEOS Development Team :-). After about two months of hacking, patching and contributing to GEOS project I've became a bit more privileged developer. This is a **big honour** for me to join the GEOS Team. I'm really happy!






I'd like to thank [Sandro Santilli](http://foo.keybit.net/~strk/) for his trust and advocacy. I'm very glad that I met Sandro on my way of life. I'd like to send **big thanks** to [Frank Warmerdam](http://home.gdal.org/~warmerda/), [Howard Butler](http://hobu.biz) and [Norman Vine](http://www.vso.cape.com/~nhv/) for promoting my simple person to GEOS project and to the World of [Open Source GIS](http://opensourcegis.org) generally. 






The main roles I'm going to play in the GEOS project are: bug tracking and fixing, refactoring, introducing new techniques and tools to improve GEOS stability as well as supporting GEOS users. I'm also working on port of GEOS library for [Windows CE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_CE) operating system (current state: compilable).
