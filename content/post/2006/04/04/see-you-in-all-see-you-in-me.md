> You are my mother, you are
my father,  you are my lover,
you are my friend
you're the beginning, you are
the center, and you are beyond
The end.
You are the colors of the raine-
bow, you are the pure white
light in me.
You are the rivers and the
mountains,  you are the stars,
you are the sea.
And I love you so, for you
help me see.  See you in all, see
you in me
For I'm in you and you're in
me.  For I am you and you are
me.
