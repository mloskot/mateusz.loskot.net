[![Boost C++ Libraries Logo](/images/logos/boost-logo.png)](http://www.boost.org)Today, I got a message announcing the first Boost conference - [BoostCon 2007](http://www.boost.org/more/BoostCon07.html). The event will take place in USA, Aspen, Colorado, in May 14-18, 2007.





### Update





Here is the [BoostCon 2007 Call for Proposals](http://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2006/09/110959.php)








It will be the first Boost conference, so organizers are not trying to make it a huge event at first but just to make it a success. And the number of attendees has been set to 100 or may be a little more. I won't go there, but I'd like to attend the next edition - BoostCon 2008 -  if possible :-)

IMHO, there is a lack of events gathering C++ geeks like Boost libraries developers and users. I'm sure the BoostCon 2007 will succeed and it will become one of the largest and very important event for C++ fans in future. By the way, for all of you interested in C++ events, there is also [ACCU Conference](http://accu.org/index.php/conferences). It has been organized by [ACCU](http://accu.org/) since 2002.
