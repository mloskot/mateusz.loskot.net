The [Chez's Dyno](http://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/c.php?i=187693) is my first 
Font 7b problem I sent in the [Southern Sandstone](http://www.ssbouldering.co.uk/).
It's a dyno, thus very difficult to find a concensus about the grade - for some it
feels easier, harder for others. That's the due to 'ungradeable' nature of dynos.

I had bloody good time working on this problem with Milo≈°:
