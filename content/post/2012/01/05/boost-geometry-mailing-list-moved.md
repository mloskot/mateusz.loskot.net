I have moved mailing list of the Boost.Geometry library from server at
[OSGeo](http://lists.osgeo.org) to [Boost](http://lists.boost.org ) mailing list server.
All existing subscribers and archives have been moved to the new server.

The new list is available at [geometry at lists dot boost dot org](http://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/geometry).
It is also mirrored at Nabble as [Boost.Geometry](http://boost-geometry.203548.n3.nabble.com/).

The old [ggl at lists dot osgeo dot org](http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/ggl) will be wiped out soon.

If anyone experiences any problems with the new geometry at lists.boost.org, please [contact](/contact) me directly.

Big thanks to the [OSGeo Foundation](http://osgeo.org) for hosting the _ggl_ mailing list and
thanks to [Boost](http://www.boost.org) admins for help with the new server.
