![GEOS Logo](/images/logos/postgis-globe-logo.gif)Short news, I've just updated and tested [GEOS](http://geos.refractions.net/) project files for Visual C++ 2005. I added new unit tests to the project. Note, that I created the project with [Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/), but you can use it with any edition of VC++ 2005.



You can download the project files for Visual C++ 2005 from my [unofficial GEOS repository](http://mateusz.loskot.net/projects/geos/). After you download the geos-msvc-2005-project.zip package, unzip it and read the README file inside. You only need to checkout GEOS sources from CVS or unpack them from the official archive. Note, that Visual C++ will launch unit tests automatically at the end of building process, as a post-build event.
