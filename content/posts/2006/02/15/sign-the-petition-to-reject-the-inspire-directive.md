![Green Globe Logo](/images/logos/greenglobe-logo.jpg)Yesterday, [Jo Walsh](http://frot.org) called on [Mapping Hacks](http://mappinghacks.com) for [signing the Petition](http://petition.publicgeodata.org) to reject the INSPIRE Directive. You can read complete Jo's story in 
[Help Petition for Public Access to Geodata in Europe](http://mappinghacks.com/index.cgi/2006/02/14#publicgeodata) post.








> Today, the Proposed INSPIRE Directive on establishing a spatial data infrastructure in Europe began the process of second reading in the European Parliament. Within one to three months, INSPIRE's provisions could become law. Many European citizens and small businesses will be negatively affected by a license, copyright and protection oriented policy towards sharing geographic data inside Europe.
