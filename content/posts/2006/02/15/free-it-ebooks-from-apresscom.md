[APress](http://www.apress.com) offers 8 titles _completely free of charge_ to download in [PDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format) format from their website - [Free eBooks](http://www.apress.com/free/).







Here is a list of free e-books (with my short comments) available to download:




	
  * **A Programmer's Introduction to PHP 4.0** - additionally I'd recommend my favourite book about [PHP](http://www.php.net) which is [Web Application Development with PHP](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735709971/202-9114118-4530217) by great webmasters Tobias Ratschiller and Till Gerken.


	
  * **Writing Perl Modules for CPAN** - I started to play with [Perl](http://www.perl.com) ~3 years ago and I'm still a beginner, so _respect_ to all Perl hackers for their gift and endurance. Two months ago I bought [Perl 6 Essentials](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perl6es/) so I'm going to refresh my Perl skills indeed :-)


	
  * **Programming VB .NET: A Guide For Experienced Programmers** - honestly I really don't like VB syntax, so I try to not to write any code in [VB](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/) and for [.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/) strongly prefer [C#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/) which is more similar to [C++](http://public.research.att.com/~bs/homepage.html) - my favourite.


	
  * **COM and .NET Interoperability** - [COM](http://www.microsoft.com/com/) is my prefered way of creating [componentised software](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computer_programming/Component_based_software_development), usually  written in C++, for Windows. I think I'll read this book to find out how to use COM technology in .NET.


	
  * **XML Programming: Web Applications and Web Services With JSP and ASP** - I don't know [Java](http://java.sun.com) langauge much besides how to write simple _Hello world!_. Java is on my TODO list for long time but there is always something (C++?) better to do than Java programming.


	
  * **Google, Amazon, and Beyond: Creating and Consuming Web Services** - I have no idea what's this book about.


	
  * **Practical Common Lisp** - I think I'll read this book soon. I always wanted to learn some real [functional language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and I was thinking about [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org) but I think Lisp should be good for learning too. Honestly, I wish to learn [**Kogut**](http://kokogut.sourceforge.net) as my first functional language but I can't wait ;-) for good tutorial from [Qrczak](http://qrnik.knm.org.pl/~qrczak/) - the Kogut's author.


	
  * **Dissecting a C# Application: Inside SharpDevelop** - this book seems to be also interesting. I hope I won't find there too much of marketing ecstasy about _how great is .NET_ as I can read [in many places](http://blogs.msdn.com/mikehall/) but only practical solutions.
