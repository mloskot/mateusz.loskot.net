![Mapnik Logo](/images/logos/mapnik-logo.png)Today, Artem Pavlenko - the leader of [Mapnik](http://www.mapnik.org) project - announced new release of Mapnik 0.3.0. _Mapnik is a [Free](http://www.mapnik.org/licence/) Toolkit for developing mapping applications._ New version brings rich set of new features.







Here I pasted Artem's e-mail posted on the [FreeGIS list](https://intevation.de/mailman/listinfo/freegis-list/):



> I'm pleased to announce a new release of Mapnik - 0.3.0. It's been a 
long time but we have lots of new features, bug fixes, improvements.

Here are the major features:
1. License changed from GPL to LGPL
2. Python-based WMS server (WMS 1.1.1 and 1.3.0)
3. New Renderer interface
4. New Feature model
5. Font engine and text symbolization
6. Python and C++ demos
7. win32 support - yes, mapnik can be compiled (tested with vc-8_0) and  happily runs on windows now. (In the future win32 binaries and/or build instructions will be provided)
8. x86_64 support
