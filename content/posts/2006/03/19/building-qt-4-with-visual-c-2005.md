![QT Logo](/images/logos/qt-logo.gif)Yesterday, I started small series of articles dedicated for [Quantum GIS](http://www.qgis.org) developers which want to work on Windows and use [Visual C++ 2005](http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/) IDE to develop QGIS. The first article is devoted to [QT](http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/index.html) compilation. Next, I'll try to explain process of building Quantum GIS using VC++ 2005.







I put this article on [QGIS Wiki](http://wiki.qgis.org) in _Developers Corner_ as [Building QT 4 with Visual C++ 2005](http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Building_QT_4_with_Visual_C%2B%2B_2005).






Building QT is the first step, so if you're going to build QGIS, you have to build QT first. There are only four steps to build [QT/Windows Open Source Edition](http://www.trolltech.com/download/opensource.html) using Visual C++ 2005.






Instructions presented in the article above are basd on [Compiling QT4 on Windows](http://psi-im.org/wiki/Compiling_Qt4_on_Windows) HOWTO from [PsiWiki](http://psi-im.org/wiki/). Thanks!
