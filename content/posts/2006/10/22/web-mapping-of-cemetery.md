Today, I found an innovative or even surprising example of [web mapping](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/webmapping/) use. On the website of [Cemeteries in Szczecin](http://cmentarze.szczecin.pl), there is an example of how web mapping technologies can be used to map cemetery. Unfortunately, the website is in [Polish langauge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language) only but I believe using maps is pretty language-less.







On the main page of the website, there is a list of all cemeteries in Szczecin. Next, you can select one of them and display detailed map, for instance of [Central Cemetery in Szczecin](http://cmentarze.szczecin.pl/showpage?chapter=11974&).






The map is clickable and provides basic navigation tools like zoom in/out, pan, full extent, displays scale, etc. There is are also other tools like [search engine](http://cmentarze.szczecin.pl/showpage?chapter=11975) with results located [results on the map](http://cmentarze.szczecin.pl/showpage?chapter=11975&smode=2&p1oid=E9F829D21DD64A488B57AE4806AEBF40). It's also possible to display aerial and satellite photos as map background.





It's not easy to find out what is this web mapping application powered by. The only thing I've managed to reveal is it's developed using application server and database called [ICOR](http://www.icor.pl). It's probably based on [MS SQL Server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server) and [ASP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages). Whatever. I think the overall concept is quite intersting and points new area for web mapping applications.
