[![Beno, my parents' new dog](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3367/3262128238_7126a8764f_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/marekloskot/sets/72157613459109253/)Beno is my parents' has new dog :-)





They took him from a dog shelter today. He is around 10 months old and seems to be of [St. Bernard Dog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bernard_%28dog%29) breed or similar or a mixture of St. Bernard. It is a big and sweet dog. My father is very happy he has new friend for long walks combined with some stop in a pub. ;-)
