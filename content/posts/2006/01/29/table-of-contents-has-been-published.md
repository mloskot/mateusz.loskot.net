![Charles Petzold Tattoo](/images/logos/charles-petzold-tattoo.jpg)Today, [Charles Petzold](http://www.charlespetzold.com) [announced](http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/01/290357.html) that he has published [Table of Contents](http://www.charlespetzold.com/wpf/) of his new book:



> I've created a page on my web site for the new book and included a Table of Contents that goes as far as I know. I hope to keep it updated as the rest of the book becomes firmer in my mind.









Charles Petzold is working on new book _Applications = Code + Markup. A Guide to the Microsoft Windows Presentation Foundation_ and he seems to not to go slow because it's comming this fall 2006:



> Yesterday I hit the 400 book pages mark. My goal of 5 books page per calendar day starting November 1st implies that I'm about a week behind. It appears now that Part 1 of the book (which sticks entirely to C# code) will be about 400 pages long.
