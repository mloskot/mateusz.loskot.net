![Windows Vista Logo](/images/logos/windows-vista-logo.png)How do you think, what kind of sounds will you hear emitted from [Windows Vista](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/default.aspx)?
Is it going to be [Rock'N'Roll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll), [Progressive rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock) or [Classical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_classical_music)? I'd love to hear [Trash Metal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_Metal) when deleting a file ,-).





It seems everything is possbile, especially when those sounds will be played by [Robert Fripp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fripp) - guitarist and the founder of [Kind Crimson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Crimson). So, it's even possible Vista will play [Math Rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_rock), whatever it is.





Why? Because Robert Fripp was invited to compose and play sounds for Windows Vista. Here is a video taken during the recording session: [Robert Fripp - Behind the scenes at Windows Vista recording session](http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=151853)





What's very interesting for me, is the way the second guy is explaining different situations and events occuring in Vista and then Robert just plays. Nice!
