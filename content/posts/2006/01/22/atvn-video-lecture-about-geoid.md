![ATVN Logo](/images/logos/atvn-logo.gif)Going on with searching new videos I walked through polish [Academic Internet Television Network](http://www.atvn.pl). There I found another interesting program titled [Geoida](http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoida), in english - [geoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid). Unfortunately, it's **only available in polish language**.








> In modern geodesy and cartography scientists use satellites to do accurate and permanent observations of the Earth's globe. Thanks to those new techniques we are able to verify geodetic and cartographic data we already have as well as collect new data about movement of the continents, measure strain in the Earth's crust, and much more. Most of all, satellite based observations help to define accurate shape of the earth - geoid.
