After [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) released [Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/) developers started to find a way how they can use [Windows Template Library](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wtl) with that free IDE and compiler. There were conducted many investigations. The results can be found on [WTL](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wtl/message/12850) or [MSDN forums](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=145975&SiteID=1) so as you can see the answer is _Yes, you can use WTL with VC++ 2005 Express Edition_. Great!






So, to make the solution available to more WTL users [Baryon Lee](http://www.bbshare.com) has published a very nice article - [Using WTL with Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition](http://www.codeproject.com/wtl/WTLExpress.asp) - in which he explains complete procedure of how to install and use WTL with VC++ 2005 Express Edition.
