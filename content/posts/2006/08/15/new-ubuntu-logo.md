[![Ubuntu Linux](/images/logos/ubuntu-logo.png)](http://www.ubuntulinux.org)While ago I was trying to find some nice Ubuntu logo I could put on my website. I opened Google and submitted it with following query: _+ubuntu +logo_. At the third position of results I saw quite encouraging title:

It wasn't what I expected, but nice.




Heh...just go and watch it yourself :-)
