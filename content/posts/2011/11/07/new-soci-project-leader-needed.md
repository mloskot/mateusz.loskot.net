[Maciej Sobczak](http://www.msobczak.com/), current leader of [SOCI](http://soci.sourceforge.net/) project has just [announced on soci-users mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=4EB709EF.7070602@msobczak.com&forum_name=soci-users) that he is looking _for a volunteer willing to take over the project leadership_. For someone, who would like to take over the project management responsibilities and has _a good understanding of the subject as well as a solid vision of what to do with the project in the future_.


SOCI is a database access library for C++ that makes the illusion of embedding [SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) queries in the regular C++ code, staying entirely within the [Standard C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++).
