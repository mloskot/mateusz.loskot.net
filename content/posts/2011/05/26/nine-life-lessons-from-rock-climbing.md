In this short talk from [TED](http://www.ted.com/), a veteran rock climber Matthew Childs shares nine pointers for rock climbing:

A few of those rules are quite well known and you can learn about them from other climbing gurus. For example:

Rules #2: Hesitation is bad
---------------------------

Yes, but patience is good what [Lynn Hill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Hill) explains in her [Pro Tips: Patience](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn3pb_49X8Q)

Rules #5: Know how to rest
--------------------------

Especially, when [your imagination becomes an unnecessary source of anxiety](http://climbingmasterclass.com/training/protips.asp?article=7) - [Johnny Dawes](http://www.johnnydawes.co.uk/) is a master _sui generis_!

Rules #7: Opposites are good
----------------------------

Plenty of related inspiration can be sourced from [Johnny Dawes](http://www.johnnydawes.co.uk/), [again](http://climbingmasterclass.com/training/protips.asp?article=7):

> People are trying what they think they should try as opposed to what they enjoy.

[Dave MacLeod](http://www.davemacleod.com/) also provokes some serious (re)thinking of any kind of goal-driven activity in his book [9 out of 10 climbers make the same mistakes](http://www.davemacleod.com/shop/9outof10climbers.html).

Rules #8: Strength =/= success
------------------------------

This is generally truth, though. No strength, no potential for proper kinetic energy. Sometimes there is no other way than to pull hard, real hard.

Rules #9: Know how to let go
----------------------------

This one is directly related or affected by the very common anxiety, the [fear of falling](http://onlineclimbingcoach.blogspot.com/2007/11/fear-of-falling.html). There is no shortcut possible that would help to overcome the fear. You have to practice falls and master the [cat righting reflex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_righting_reflex). Practice makes perfect.

...in climbing, in life.
