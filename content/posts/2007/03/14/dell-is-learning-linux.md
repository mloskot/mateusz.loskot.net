[![Designed For Linux Icon under GPL](/images/logos/designed_for_linux_logo.png)/>](http://www.kde-files.org/content/show.php?content=50908)Recently, it's been quite loudly about Dell plans related to Linux operating system. First, we were told that [Pre-Installed Linux On Dells are Coming](http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/02/25/2110219). This message made happy every fun of Dell laptops, including me.




Three days later,  we heard: [Not So Fast](http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/02/28/0115255) what was like a bucket of cold water over my head. _Shame, Mr. Dell!_





Today news has dispelled clouds and we can see the sun again about the _Linux on Dell laptops_. Here is the latest note from [Dell's blog](http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/03/13/7985.aspx):



> We recognize some people prefer notebooks over desktops, high-end models over value models, your favorite Linux distribution, telephone-based support over community-based support, and so on.  We canât offer everything (all systems, all distributions, all support options), so weâve crafted a survey to let you help us prioritize what we should deliver for you.



You can check the survey here: [http://www.dell.com/linuxsurvey](http://www.dell.com/linuxsurvey)





The update comment sounds very promising: _(...) We're overwhelmed by your responses, and we know the survey server is overloaded too (...)_. For me, it means there is a huge demand for Linux on Dell laptops, so we have a chance to get rid pre-installed Windows on new Dell's.




...and, Mr. Dell, please don't forget to replace the _Designed for Windows_ sticker with **Designed for Linux**_ :-)
