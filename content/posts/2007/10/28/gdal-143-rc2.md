This is **very important update** to the _GDAL 1.4.3 Release Candidate 1_ published yesterday. I **screwed** and generated GDAL 1.4.3 RC1 packages with sources from **trunk**, so users found it surprising when they encountered a bunch of new features and drivers. On the other hand, it was a pre-announcement of the GDAL 1.5.0 release :-P






Here is the official announcement sent on the [gdal-dev](http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2007-October/014644.html) list:

Folks,

*** IMPORTANT ***
I appologize for my mistake during preparation of gdal-1.4.3 RC1
and you got sources from 'trunk' instead of from 'branches/1.4'.
Following GDAL 1.4.3 RC 2 is dedicated to correct this issue.
Special thanks to Joaquim Luis reporting the problem very fast.
