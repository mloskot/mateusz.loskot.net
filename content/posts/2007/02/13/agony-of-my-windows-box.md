[![Dell twins](http://mateusz.loskot.net/gallery/_gallery_albums_store/dell/dell_twins_5.thumb.jpg)](http://mateusz.loskot.net/gallery/dell/dell_twins_5) For last 2 weeks, I've been observing a slow agony of my desktop machine running [Windows XP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP) - random restarts and freezes, [BIOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS) settings resetting on every boot, etc. In Friday, these problems entered the final stage. In Sunday, my machine was dead.
This is not a high quality computer but the only I have to run Windows operating system on it, and very important projects I'm working on under Windows system got suspended for a while. I really don't like low cost desktops...





I decided to jump for shopping to find some new-old but stable machine to be able to continue my Windows work on it. So, I defined quite short list of requirements for new system: well-known brand, stability, _no more desktops_, plus good price but not a low-cost computer. Ah, I've for got about one: no [Windows Vista](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista) - [a hardware killer](http://www.daniweb.com/blogs/entry360.html) :-)







I decided to visit a notebooks reseller [where I bought my first](http://www.tajne.eu/) Dell Latitude D600 one year ago. After a year working on Dell laptops I felt in love in this computers and I completely confirm what you can read [about Dell Latitude laptops brand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Latitude) on the Wikipedia - _standardized parts are used throughout the line_. For me, that means you can expect high stability and operability.





Finally, I found another piece of Dell Latitude D600 but a bit newer, manufactured in 2005 and equipped with newer CPU than my first Latitude model. Here is the specification overview:




  * CPU: Pentium M 1.8 GHz, 745 series, codename [Dothan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dothan)  with 2 MB cache, 90nm process


  * RAM: 1024 MB


  * HDD:  Hitachi Travelstar DK23FB-60, 60 GB, 5400 RPM, ATA-5


  * [ATI Mobility Radeon 9000](http://ati.amd.com/products/MobilityRadeon9000/index.html) with 32 MB memory


  * Screen: [SXGA+](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SXGA%2B) with 1400x1050 display resolution








My first D600 is almost the same, but it is equipped with older release of Pentium M CPU. So, I'd say I've got Dell twins now :-) . I know Latitude brand laptops well and they are very stable thus perfect for professionals.





Unfortunately, Windows installation didn't go as smoothly as buying new laptop :-). I have Windows XP CD with Service Pack 1. I installed the Windows XP system, then I installed Visual Studio 2005 and a lot of other software I use every day. Next, I started the big task of Windows Update and after 3 hours of trying to a) download and b) install Service Pack 2 I gave up. The Service Pack 2 installation was hanging every time while collecting configuration details. Seems it was just too easy to be true so far.





Today morning I attempted to _get Windows box working_ task again. I got newer Windows XP CD-ROM bundled with Service Pack 2. After 40 minutes the system was working on my laptop. After next ~1.5 hours I got Visual Studio 2005 on it too. After next 2 hours it was after the big Windows Update. Yes, **big** is a very appropriate word to describe the update because it needed to download ~500 MB of fixes, packs, and updates. Now, I'm going to copy all my projects and data from old disk drive what will surely take a few more hours ;-).





The main conclusion I've came to is that having a stable and long-lasting hardware and software environment is a bless. All _spring-clean_ and re-installation is a real pain in the ass.
