![Extended STL](http://synesis.com.au/publishing/xstl/xstlv1-thumb.jpg)The [Extended STL](http://extendedstl.com/) is a new [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++) book written by Matthew Wilson. The first volume **Collections and Iterators** will be available in June 2007. Second volume **Algorithms, Functions and Exotic Matter** been also planned but it is _still very much up in the air_. The book will discuss:



> principles and practices of STL extension, many of which are used in the implementation of the [STLSoft](http://synesis.com.au/software/stlsoft/) libraries








The first Matt Wilson's book - [The Imperfect C++](http://www.imperfectcplusplus.com/) - presented C++ language programming in a very practical way. This book has two faces. It is a C++ introductory book and it also presents various C++ weaknesses and their solutions at the same time. The Extended STL will be a kind of continuation and focus on the [Standard Template Library](http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/). According to my understanding, Matt will try to present programmers with solutions of how to use C++ techniques and STL concepts with existing code bases and technologies, for instance how to use STL [collections](http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Container.html) with [COM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_object_model) objects.





Certainly, the range of topics will be much wider. As presented in the TOC, most of _must-understand_ concepts will be presented there, like [RAII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAII), constraints and [contract programming](http://www.artima.com/cppsource/deepspace.html), and much more.





I think the new book will also be a perfect completion to Nicolai M. Josuttis' [The C++ Standard Library - A Tutorial and Reference](http://www.josuttis.com/libbook/index.html).
