Every day (almost) I spend long hours in front of computer screen and terminal emulator window. Obviously, it's not comfortable nor healthy for my eyes at all. So, I decided to try to find a way to help my eyes feeling a little better, so they are not mad at me all the time.





_What can I do for you, my little beauties else, besides turning off anti-aliasing and other subpixel rendering features on my machines?_





_Find a better font!_, voices behind my back whispered.

I found **Terminus** - the best monospaced terminal font ever. It's much better than Monaco and any other fonts I've tried. Terminus was produced by [Dimitar Zhekov](http://www.is-vn.bg/hamster/jimmy-en.html) and is available under terms of the [GNU General Public License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php). Dimitar is writing on his website:


> Terminus Font is designed for long (8 and more hours per day) work with computers.


and I can confirm these words after I've been using the Terminus font for a couple of days.


 


Originally, Terminus is dedicated to be compiled for Unix and [X11 Window System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11), so it's difficult to make it working well on [Mac OS X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X) and Windows systems. [Eric Cheng](http://fractal.csie.org/~eric/wiki/Terminus_font) prepared and published [TrueType](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType) version of the font. There is also available another version of TrueType Terminus created by _Simon 'corecode' Schubert_ who reported that Eric's version did not work well for him. I tested them on my Mac OS X 10.4 with [Terminal.app](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(application)) and I don't see any difference, both versions work well.





**Update** from [tryphon](/?p=223#comment-2302): don't forget to turn **anti-aliasing off**, since this is a bitmap font





There used to be a Wiki on Eric's website with more information about terminal fonts and the Terminus. Unfortuantelly, due to spam attacks Eric had to close it. In order to save Eric's and Simons' great work, I decided to pack these fonts together and mirror here: [terminus-font.tar.gz](/download/tools/terminus-font.tar.gz)





I hope it will help someone to make his eyes happy :-)
