[![JTC1/SC22/WG21 - The C++ Standards Committee](/images/iwantyou.jpg)](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/)Today, [Bronek Kozicki](http://www.artima.com/cppsource/rvalue.html)  - a member of [BSI](http://www.bsi-global.com/) C++ panel - shared some bad news on [ACCU](http://accu.org/) mailing list, about sponsorship problems of [WG21](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/) meeting in March 2009:



> I just learned that original sponsor of this meeting backed out, leaving guys from [EDG](http://www.edg.com/) not only with organizational tasks, but also financial burden.






So, Bronek has also put out call for help to all interested parties:



> Therefore, it would really nice if those of ACCU members who are working in large companies (and which also happen to utilize [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) to great extent) could pass a message up the management chain that sponsoring [ISO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization)/[IEC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission) committee meeting is unusual and very prestigious [PR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations) opportunity. Sponsors of past meetings include **Intel**, **Microsoft** and **Google**, among other IT giants; unfortunately EDG is only _giant in intelectual sense_.





If your managers find this opportunity compelling, please contact them with J. Stephen Adamczyk (jsa (at) [edg](http://www.edg.com/) (dot) com).
