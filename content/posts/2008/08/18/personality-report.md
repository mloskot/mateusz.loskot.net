It's time to take a look [in the mirror](http://www.brainbench.com) and bare all the devilish traits of my exhibitionistic ;-) personality.

### Your Social Boldness: Introverted VS Extraverted




You are slightly extraverted. It's so nice to be you. You are comfortable being the center of attention, and you are just as comfortable sitting back and letting others take the spotlight. Your warm and friendly personality allows you to take a leadership role - that is, if you want it. In general, you do not mind public speaking, but sometimes you have to be in the proper frame of mind to feel at ease when making a presentation. When you believe in something, you do not hesitate to state your mind. People enjoy when you do this, because you have a cheerful way about you. At times, you seek thrills, and adventure, but a night home relaxing is just as fun for you.


 


### Your Agreeableness: Candid VS Considerate




You are very considerate. You are a popular person, aren't you? Of course you are. You truly value harmony in dealing with others. People recognize your friendly, generous, and helpful personality. Your easy-going, agreeable nature makes you such a joy to be around. This is especially true in meetings or general conversations. The topic may become heated, but you are considerate of other's feelings and you will find a happy medium in order to placate those around you. This is because you have an optimistic view of human nature and you realize that if you trust people with their decisions that they are not trying to hurt you or take advantage of you. This special and rare quality is also seen in your altruism. You enjoy helping others. To you it is not a sacrifice; to you it is fulfilling to help others in need.





### Your Self-Control: Impulsive VS Cautious





You are slightly impulsive. Sometimes you exhibit great self-control, other times you like to have fun and be impulsive. You are able to balance the two, so that you are neither perceived as stuffy or out of control. You see value in rules, yet you know when rules can be altered and when you must adhere to them. Employers value your strong work ethic, and your friends and coworkers value your playful side. Your flexible personality makes you very popular at work, because you know when to work and when to play without jeopardizing jobs or friendships. Your success in life is due to your perseverance in pursuing goals you have established for yourself. In general, you like to think before you act, but when a situation arises where that is not feasible, you are able to make smart decisions quickly.


 


### Your Anxiety Level: Excitable VS Relaxed





You are slightly excitable. You have the ability to cope just fine in stressful situations. You feel the stress and frustration in pressure-filled situations, but you are able to overcome any negative feelings. You tend to worry slightly, but not enough to interfere with your activities. If you are experiencing a tough time in your life, you are able to stave off feelings of depression. You are able to think clearly and realistically in difficult circumstances, so that you can devise a sensible solution. Sometimes you can be impatient, other times you can be relaxed - it just depends on the circumstance and how much you can control it. People are not afraid that you will lose your temper. You are able to manage your emotions when necessary. When you do become angry, it is only because something is out of your power.





### Your Openness to Change: Practical VS Imaginative





You are moderately practical. You tend to be more comfortable when your daily activities are familiar and unchanging, rather than constantly in a state of flux. You prefer to deal with facts and not ideas. You prefer to be more practical and pragmatic, but you are able to be creative when the situation calls for it. You prefer the conversation or situation to be more straightforward. Emotionally, you are more conservative and tend not to express your feelings openly. You have a proper demeanor, which summons respect from those around you.





### The way you Think/Reason: Concrete VS Abstract





You are quite abstract in your thinking. You tend to be quick to grasp ideas, are a fast learner and intelligent. You possess a hallmark of intelligence that potentially separates human beings from earlier life forms, the ability to think about future consequences before acting on an impulse. Your reasoning activity involves contemplation of long-range goals, organizing and planning routes to these goals, and persisting toward one's goals in the face of short-lived impulses to the contrary. You also have keen interests in intellectual matters and love to play with ideas and think theoretically. You tend to be open-minded to new and unusual ideas, and like to debate intellectual issues. You often enjoy riddles, puzzles, and brainteasers.
