Recently, I've been playing with [Sanoodi](http://sanoodi.com/) - _activity-based social networking website for participants in sports and leisure activities_. The idea of Sanoodi is very similar to [Sports Tracker](http://sportstracker.nokia.com) by Nokia.





The Sanoodi version 1.1.0.0 is based on Google Maps API. It works well, rarely reporting errors. Today, I migrated my account to [Sanoodi Beta](http://beta.sanoodi.com/) available for mysterious [Friday the 13th](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th) (month unspecified :-)). Besides _new & ugly_ user interface, I've encountered that mapping capabilities in [Beta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta) are based on [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) engine. Great choice, if my vote counts. The core of Sanoodi application is based on [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) framework. Another good choice :-)





If you are doing any outdoor activities, Sanoodi is a nice gadget and worth to try. I recommend to use [version 1.1.0.0](http://sanoodi.com/home.html) for regular diary. In my opinion, the Beta version is still unusable. It is throwing errors while saving preferences or uploading [GPX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPX) file, Save button for new route sees to be not even linked, etc. BTW, I've reported all my problems to the [Sanoodi Team](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanoodi). Hopefully, they will fix it soon.
