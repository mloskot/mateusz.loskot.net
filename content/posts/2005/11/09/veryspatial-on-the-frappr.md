![VerySpatial.com Logo](/images/logos/veryspatial-logo.jpg)[Recently](http://mateusz.loskot.net/2005/11/05/gis-bloggers-map/), I announced [GIS Bloggers Map](http://www.frappr.com/gisbloggers). Today, I'd like to announce another GIS users map on the [Frappr!](http://www.frappr.com).

Sue & Jesse from the [VerySpatial.com](http://veryspatial.com) vortal and blog have launched [VerySpatial](http://www.frappr.com/veryspatial) users map on the  [Frappr!](http://http://www.frappr.com).Great! Go on, [add yourself](http://www.frappr.com/veryspatial#addyourself) and have fun!

By the way, [GIS Bloggers Map](http://www.frappr.com/gisbloggers) is growing with more users. Today, we have **8** users [applause] :-). There is only one problem with [Frappr!](http://http://www.frappr.com) engine, it works a bit buggy when you put URL in the Shoutout field. URLs are displayed incorrectly in the mug box appearing on the map after you click on the member link to get his location. I wrote to the [Frappr!](http://www.frappr.com) guys and I'm sure they will fix it. Thanks Frappr'ers!
