Yesterday, I  sent my second bug report to the Ubuntu bug tracking system, 
but this time not to [Bugzilla](http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com),
but to the brand new [Malone](https://launchpad.net/products/malone).

So, here is the number [#2681](https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+sources/alexandria/+bug/2681).

This bug report refers to [Alexandria](http://alexandria.rubyforge.org) - books collection manager. 
Simply, I'm not able to run it at all. [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) interpreter 
insists there are some files missing. I can not help Ruby and tell him how to run Alexandria 
successfully, because I'm not a Ruby guru. So, we need both to wait until this bug will be fixed ,-)

Unfortunately, it turned out pretty fast that my bug report is a duplicate of an existing bug. 
But I'm not worry about it. I'm sure it's better for developers to have more bug reports, even duplicated, than less.
