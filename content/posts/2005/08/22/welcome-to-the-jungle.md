I lanuched my [website/blog](http://mateusz.loskot.net) about more than month ago, but I had had no time to put any content here. Tonight, I sat down and write a few chapters about me. If you are curious what I scribbled read [About](http://mateusz.loskot.net/about/) section.
So, if you have any question or comment don't hesitate to [write](http://mateusz.loskot.net/about/contact) to me.
If you like pictures, visit [my world](http://mateusz.loskot.net/about/world/) on the map. I'm not a pro traveller, so there are many places I've never been, but in some I have.Now, I think I've got some wind in my sails and I will keep my site fresh.
