I've just realized my website title is incorrect. It <del>advertises</del> used to advertise _Into the Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial_. However, I don't aim to write only about FOSS4G development, but I aim to write about development of geospatial software in general. So, the new title has been introduced: _Into the Source of Software for Geospatial_.




Nevertheless, most of the content I generate discuss development of Open Source projects. Is that a coincidence? Hmm, I have to think deeper about it.
