Let's take [the leader of](http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/) [Colossus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer) reconstruction project, [the author](http://www.simonsingh.net/) of [The Code Book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Code_Book), [the original creator](http://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/background/index.html) of the [PGP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) e-mail encryption package and [horde of people as hungry of knowledge & fun](http://accu.org) as a bears of berries, and what you get?

You get [ACCU :: Security: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow](http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2009_security) conference:




> On November 7th 2009, the [ACCU](http://accu.org) will be holding a one day conference at Bletchley Park, home of the legendary World War II 'Enigma' code breakers, and the site at which the world's first digital computer went operational.





The event is [put on the official calendar of events](http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/calendar/event_detail.rhtm?cat=special&recID=588375) in [Bletchley Park - National Codes Centre](http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/). It's also [announced by ZDNet](http://www.zdnet.co.uk/trackback/0,1000001387,10014012o-2000331828b,00.htm).





By the way, [who knows about the crucial role](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8158782.stm) of the [Polish Cipher Bureau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biuro_Szyfr%C3%B3w) and Polish mathematical geniuses in breaking [Enigma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine)? I can bet that many people still believe [in this story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-571_(film)) which follows [principles of canonical Hollywood education](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WALIARHHLII).





> [I think one of the things we need to make clear to Hollywood](http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/e-h/film-u571.html) is, yes you're in the entertainment business but the people who see your movies are going to come away thinking that's information, not just entertainment.





By the way, I've read on [ACCU](http://accu.org) forum that one of the speakers will probably talk about new his [VoIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_Internet_Protocol) protocol and why his protocol spanks all other VoIP protocols as well as the effects of public policy and living in a surveillance society. The conference is going to kick!
