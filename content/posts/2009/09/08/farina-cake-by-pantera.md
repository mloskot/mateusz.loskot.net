This is recipe for delicious cake based on [Petit Beurre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz-Keks) biscuits and [farina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farina_(food)). The recipe was originally invented by my love [Pantera](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/tags/pantera). So, let's make it [CC BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) :-)





First, you need about 80 Petit Beurre / Leibniz-Keks biscuits. Easy. Second, find Polish shop and get some pack of farina. Might be tricky. Next, make some mess ;-) There are two masses to be prepared and both are mostly based on the same ingredients.





First mass:






  * 1/2 glass of white or brown sugar


  * vanilla sugar (small pack)


  * 1 glass of milk


  * 1/2 cube of butter


  * 3 table spoons of Cacao


  * 1/2 glass of Farina





Second mass:






  * 1/2 glass of white or brown sugar


  * vanilla sugar (small pack)


  * 1 glass of milk


  * 1/2 cube of butter


  * 1/2 glass of Farina


  * You can also add almonds, nuts, raisins, etc.





For the finishing touch, you will need chocolate custard, banana, almonds, nuts, and whatever your own taste would suggest you.





Make the first mass: mix and boil milk with butter and sugar. When milk is boiled, slow down the heat and add farina gradually and continue to mix. Cook all together for 3-4 minutes continuously mixing so farina doesn't sear (burn). At the end of cooking after 3-4 minutes add Cacao. Make the second mass the same way as the first one with two exceptions:






  1. If you want to add almonds, nuts, etc. add them after the milk (with sugar and butter) is boiled.


  2. Don't add the Cacao at the end.





The procedure is as follows:






  1. Make a layer of the Petit Beurre biscuits on the bottom of the cake tin.


  2. Pour hot first mass (the Cacao mass) to the tin.


  3. Cover the mass with another layer of the biscuits.


  4. Pour hot second mass to the tin on top of the second layer of biscuits.


  5. Cover the second mass with another layer of biscuits.


  6. Finish covering the top layer of buscuits with chocolate custard and dredge with nuts, almonds, coconut chips, slices of banana, ...whatever you like :-)


  7. You can combine as many layers of the mass and biscuits as you like.





Be aware that the hot mass congeals quite fast, so it is important to hurry with making the cake layers.





Schmeckt Gut!
