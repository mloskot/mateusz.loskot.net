Two months ago Barend Gehrels [announced](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2009-February/005002.html) on the [OSGeo Discuss](http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss) list ongoing [Open Source](http://www.opensource.org/) project called [Generic Geometry Library](http://geometrylibrary.geodan.nl/), GGL in short.





The Generic Geometry Library provides a generic implementation of geometry algorithms, working with geometry types provided by the library itself as well as user-defined types. The library is implemented in [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) programming language with extensive use of elements of [metaprogramming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming) like class (type) [templates](http://ubiety.uwaterloo.ca/~tveldhui/papers/Template-Metaprograms/meta-art.html), [static polymorphism](http://www.josuttis.com/tmplbook/) and [compile-time execution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compile-time_execution). Consequently, GGL is built upon two of the _greatest pieces of C++ code_ ever written by humanity: [C++ Standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_standard_library) [Library](http://www.josuttis.com/libbook/) and [Boost C++ Libraries](http://www.boost.org/).





In my opinion, this project is valuable and have potential which may interest many of us, [FOSS4G](http://foss4g.org/) users and developers. The [OSGeo Foundation](http://osgeo.org/) agreed to host this mailing list [ggl@lists.osgeo.org](http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/ggl) dedicated to discussions development and use of the Generic Geometry Library.
