Hot temperatures have been invading Poland this summer, clearly. So, [my father](http://www.flickr.com/photos/marekloskot/3260778925/) invented [a cooling solution](http://www.flickr.com/photos/marekloskot/3757452899/in/set-72157613459109253/) for his [well-beloved dog](/?p=165) [Beno](http://www.flickr.com/photos/marekloskot/sets/72157613459109253/).

Certainly, [Beno understands what's the purpose of that effort very well](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/personal/08/07/smart.dogs/). He also has a very well developed spatial orientation and can easily memorise where all cool places are located around the yard and in the country side. When my father is walking Beno [in the fields around the town](http://maps.google.pl/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=pl&geocode=&q=strzelce+opolskie&sll=52.025459,19.204102&sspn=7.926748,23.269043&ie=UTF8&z=13) and Beno recognizes they are near his favourite pond, he tries to pull in that direction or just runs a few hundreds meters and jumps to the water. And, he doesn't use TomTom for that purpose ;-)
