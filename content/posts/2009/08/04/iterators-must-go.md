I've already [announced](http://mateusz.loskot.net/?p=731) the brilliant and provocative presentation given by [Andrei Alexandrescu](http://erdani.org/) titled [Iterators Must Go!](http://www.boostcon.com/site-media/var/sphene/sphwiki/attachment/2009/05/08/iterators-must-go.pdf).





Here is video of Andrei's keynote digged to [boostcon.blip.tv](http://boostcon.blip.tv/):







It may seem this is a [C++](/category/programming/cpp/) oriented presentation, but in fact it's more related to software design, [design patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)) and [idioms](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms), [interface oriented design](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/kpiod/interface-oriented-design), [programming by contract](http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/dbc.html) and...shortly, it's really worthwhile to watch, during lunchtime of course ;-), and enjoy!
