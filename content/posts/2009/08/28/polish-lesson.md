Would you like to learn something about my country? Here is a [short tutorial](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10317763-56.html?tag=mncol;title). Apparently, Microsoft has conducted deep marketing research in Poland and learned [what does the reality look like in my country](http://www.europeancourier.org/RacismEurope_07_03_06.htm). The terribly woeful, yet shameless, thing is that they try to make a profit of that "knowledge". Microsoft spokesman Lou Gellos tried out a miserable trick posting [micro-apology](http://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/3546312485) squeezing it somewhere between new tools in Office package and green energy links. Bloody amateurs!





I'm sorry for my country!
