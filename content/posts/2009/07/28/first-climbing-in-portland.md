Last Saturday, [Pantera](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/tags/pantera/), my friend [Roger](http://www.ukclimbing.com/forums/profile.php?id=32379) and [I](http://www.ukclimbing.com/forums/profile.php?id=99771), we spent a wonderful day on the [Isle of Portland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Portland).





Thanks to Pantera, we have collected quite a nice photo & video [log](http://www.ukclimbing.com/forums/profile.php?id=99771) from during the trip including walking, swimming, climbing, [soloing (DWS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep-water_soloing), eating and sleeping. All the stuff available on my [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/sets/72157621844149926/)

It was my first time in [Portland](http://www.rockfax.com/) and I'll definitely come back there.
