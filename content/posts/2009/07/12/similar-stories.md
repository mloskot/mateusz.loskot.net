I'm a user of [Pentax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentax_K10D) hardware and I like reading [Joel Cornuz](http://jcornuz.wordpress.com/about-me/)' [blog dedicated to Linux & Photography and Pentax](http://jcornuz.wordpress.com) too. I was amazed how similar Joel's and mine Linux stories are:





> I have also been using Linux for quite some years (starting in the days where having an up and running X server was a good week of hard work?) and have since then tried to use Linux for photography ? these days, I run Ubuntu for it?s ease of use.





I still remember the times when I was staying at my [past employer](http://www.mv.pl/) office (nearly) every Friday overnight to download, install and learn Linux and programming. That days, I could only dream about broadband at home. The time is running <del>so</del> too fast!
